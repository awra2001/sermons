- The excerpt of Dr. King’s sermon delivered in the late 1950s ends with a powerful charge: “This is the letter, and now comes the living of it.”
- And in the context of the last couple weeks of tracing the story of Jesus, we’re asked to consider two major messages that we must live into:
	- The scroll in Isa - that the good news is here to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor - the jubilee - when all will be restored
	- And that it is not just for those who believe they are first in line to receive it, but it’s for all people.
	* It’s not easy, though... we can almost relegate these ideas into lofty hopes and dreams, and what could be, but what must be.  Jesus is not just preaching ideals, he’s the embodiment of God’s promises made very real.
	* There’s these moments in ourselves that I think we want to be better than we are.  	
	* But I think there’s a deeper, more significant statement that we carry in our hearts - that somehow, we’re not going to be good enough
	* Are we able to live this life Jesus calls us to?
	* Tl;dr: Yes, but it requires something of us.
* In the places where we are, in a remarkable way, Jesus calls us as we are to live in a remarkable way. 
	* “Put out in the deep water and let your nets down for a catch"
		* Jesus calls us in the places where we are.
			* Simon Peter wasn’t asked to do be something he wasn’t right away.
			* Jesus encounters him in the normal, every day circumstances.
			* Here’s one of those stories we tell ourselves - that we have to do something incredible.  Maybe we don’t.  Maybe we just do what we are called to.
	* “We have worked all night long but have caught nothing"
		* This is the honest response to the remarkable request that Jesus asks of us: we have tried to live the letter, and what do we have to show for it?
		* Our boxes can sometimes betray us here too.  Like, Jesus would want us to do that?
			* That ministry didn’t work
			* No one will show up to this thing
			* If we try to care for these people, put our necks out for this thing, what’s going to be the benefit?
			* The Spirit leads us
			* And if we don’t put the net in we’ll never know.
	* “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!"
		* Who are we to decide who Jesus cannot call into ministry?
		* Who are we to decide all of the sudden that Jesus can’t call us?
		* Sometimes it’s an honest admission of what we see as our brokenness and inability
		* At its worst, it’s a self-centered approach of protection (keystone and foundations staying firm)
		* Jesus doesn’t call the qualified, he qualifies the called.
			* And if you want to have a quick summation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures, that’s your line.  That’s ISA - and even with the difficult things he will need tell the people, God will be with him.
			* And Paul reminds us of that too.
		* Jesus’ response, too
			* Not shaming Peter
			* Not even forgiving him
			* There’s work to do.  
* Our Application: we can be part of the impossible
	* The impossible is not just about the moment, but about everything we do after that moment.
	* What if Peter had stayed?
		* Not cast the nets again?
		* Lived only in his sinful nature?
		* Jesus would continue his ministry, sure, but Peter’s story would have been not nearly the same.
		* Where’s the nudge this week in the ordinary?
			* Reaching out one last time to someone
			* Going to that meeting, that study, that whatever
			* Mailing that last card
			* We never know when that’s our moment.
