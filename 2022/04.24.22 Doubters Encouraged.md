# 04.24.22: Doubters Encouraged

![[04.m4a]]

* We're using Eastertide to talk more about how an Easter moment became and Easter movement.  How does this become an idea and a faith that spreads throughout the world, and reverberates?
* And we start in part how we'll end this period - with the Holy Spirit being given, this time to the disciples. 
* But, predominately, this passage is taken up mostly by Thomas.
	* Now, he was called the twin, but we have another name for him - Doubting Thomas
	* And that how he always remains.  And from this is shaped our understanding of doubt as well.
* Our feelings of doubt come from two places in the text
	* Thomas' comment to the disciples saying that he wouldn't believe until he could touch the wounds of Jesus
	* And then Jesus' remark later: "Blessed are those who have not see and yet have come to believe"
	* Altogether, that's a pretty straightforward argument. Those who doubt are less blessed, like Thomas.
	* But, unexamined in this is what doubt is in the first place.  So let's look there first.
* Doubt
	* Andrew Moon (assoc professor of philosophy at Va Commonwealth): two kinds of doubt:
		* One based on reason - we doubt that the Jaguars will win the Super Bowl for, y'know, every reason possible.
		* One based on conscious awareness and their strength - Perhaps I've been having doubts about whether I can ride the big bike race I'm planning in the fall.
			* Right now, not having started training, I feel a lot of doubt
			* But, once I begin to train, start to make decisions that dedicate time to getting on my bike, the strength of my doubt will change, because my conscious awareness will change also.
		* Both of those though, don't ignore that in the midst of doubt, there can be belief.
		* So taken together, perhaps the best definition of doubt is that one has doubt if and only if one believes one might be wrong, which is better than saying if any only if one has less than the highest degree of confidence - this is where Moon lands.
	* This seems at play here in our text today:
		* It's once again worth remembering like last week that we situate ourselves in time - the crucifixion was still just a couple days ago.
		* Thomas, like the others, is still reeling from what he's witnessed, as anyone else.
		* His supposition might well be that given what occurred, there is no way that Jesus is alive.  He's having some doubts about Jesus, and they're very conscious, and very strong.  He seems to have very strong thoughts that he may have been wrong (and hold a pin in whether or not he "believes")
		* And, moreover, we see that the other disciples had already seen Jesus and the wounds.  It is after that witness that they begin to rejoice.  Thomas wasn't there (not fearfully hiding in the upper room like the others)
		* Thomas requests then some empirical proof to see that Jesus is alive: he wants to be strengthened in his position.  And Jesus obliges, which should make us pause for a moment.  If somehow, this was wrong, why wouldn't Jesus pivot a different direction?
* And here's the kicker of all this - Jesus, in 20:27 in our translation here says "Do not doubt, but believe"
	* But that's not what the greek says AT ALL.
	* Instead, it's more of constructions of opposites (that a lot of other translations pick up on): Jesus is saying to Thomas, don't get into a condition of unbelief, but instead, believe.
	* So really, doubt isn't the thing at play here at all - but a spectrum of belief, that apparently hasn't even gone to unbelief at all.  So it isn't Doubting Thomas, it's Thomas, dealing-with-a-lot-of-really-difficult-things-and-as-a-result-might-be-struggling-with-his-beliefs-although-not-apparently-completely.  But that's not nearly as easy to say.
* But that doesn't mean we shouldn't refocus our attention on doubt - in fact, even with the mistranslation here, we still can learn.
	* The opposite of doubt isn't really belief, it's certainty.
	* And certainty is also not necessarily belief, either.
	* Let's say that Thomas was so convinced that things were going downhill, that even with Jesus offering to show his hands, feet, and side, that he wasn't do be convinced.  That he was that certain.  That would have ended his journey right there.
	* It is the pinprick of uncertainty though, that reminds us of our beliefs, and might spurn us on to seek evidence, which Jesus doesn't deny or discourage. 
* I might argue instead that it is precisely the pursuit that is the foundation of moving Easter from a moment to a movement.
	* If we don't hear the "blessing" as the opposite of a "woe,"  or a mark of shame for Thomas (which by extension would have been every other disciple as well), but instead as a compliment of those who will come after the disciples, we see that these efforts of seeking and finding even while not getting the physical evidence that might fully convince us. As a result, our faith is more deeply earned, precisely by the doubts that drive us.
	* Pope Francis says it like this: “If one has the answers to all the questions—that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.”
	* If we believe that all there is to faith is belief unto certainty, can place us into a mindset of blithe self-assurance that doesn't offer much space for critical engagement, and may also mean that we require only the bare minimum of insight into our beliefs in order to sustain our confidence.  Certainty becomes defensively structural, not spiritual.
	* But remember - we started and will end this time with the Holy Spirit.
		* Doubt's companion may very well be the Holy Spirit.
		* As an unquenchable, free moving fire, it does not lend itself well to defensive structures, but instead will go where God is alive and working in the world.
		* Perhaps then we should always allow ourselves to have a posture of doubt, because if we always think to some degree we may be wrong (or perhaps better: we are not fully convinced we have it all right), then we might seek out the Spirit.
		* And where the Spirit is is where Jesus' resurrection still happens, and the movement persists.
