* Been a lot of fun to talk to folks about their thoughts about one twin here at PH.
* Understandably frustrated about the live stream, but if you’ve been able to be here it’s been pleasant… folks on balance seen to really enjoy it
* Its an intimate, stripped down space... don't have all the bells + whistles over on the other side of the street, but it had what we needed
	* Not near the organ, or the choir, no Cadillac pulpit… didn’t even need a microphone
	* Sometimes that distilled moment is what we need... clarity in chaos, less confusion, simplicity in a complex world
* James distills for us life in community together
* Healing
* Joy
* Confession
* Forgiveness
* All of these are active, pointing both to God and to the other
* Community is built through prayer
* The onus is on the rescuer, not the one being rescued as is the reward
* Mk helps us the about this more in-depth
	* Not against us is for us/a cup of water
	* Not all who wander are lost this too is the distilled clarity we need
