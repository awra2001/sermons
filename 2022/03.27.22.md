# 03.27.22: Works of Love

![[03.m4a]]

* I know we've spent a lot of time talking about the practices of lent, and how they help us distill our calling, help us to live as Easter people later.
* But, I also know that can feel a little naive at times.  Singular actions on their own might not make it easy to see how it works going forward.
* Imagine it like a complex 1000 piece puzzle
	* We can see the end goal on the box - and in the most complex puzzles, they can be the most simple designs
	* Then you dump the pieces out, and that's a whole other story.
	* However, there's always a process
		* Some folks will start working edges
		* Others will look for pieces that connect
		* And sometimes strategies will overlap based on what's in front of us
		* But, eventually, with enough patience and effort, you get there.
	* I don't know how you get there, though, without the metaview. 
	* All of these disciplines have to have some bigger picture so that as the puzzle pieces are starting to come together, you can reference back to something.
* If we were going to work out a puzzle based off of today's text, I'd love to have a picture of the banquet after this scene
	* We're not privvy to it, so we can use our imaginations (Abraham Bosse, a French artist, did in 1636)
	* The best of the best is laid out for the community after the son who left returns home - it is grand!
	* And we hope that the eldest son has heard his father, and has joined them in the celebration
	* That final piece of reconciliation and hope is beautiful - what we'd want to see in the end.
* But even in the text, see how much had to be done to get there... how pieces of the puzzle start to come together.
	* Self-Reflection abounds
		* He takes his wealth, and the greek gives us a sense that he's generally undisciplined - scattershot, partying hard. He was senseless.  This is what "prodigal" means.
		* And then, a fast was foisted upon him because of the severe famine
		* Then, he has a moment at the lowest when he comes to himself, literally... which required a moment of self-reflection, precipitated by the worst of circumstances, some his responsibility, some not (the severe famine)...
		* And that moment of self-reflection brings him to a moment of both penitence and repentance!
	* Penitence/Repentance
		* Like we talked about before, they can have similar meanings, but also different
			* Penitent: he was willing to be transactional
			* Repentant: but also transformational
			* And if you recall, Jesus argues that if can't get to that moment, we might actually lose out on the love and grace on the other side
* Works of love
	* There are two important works of love that the father represents here:
		* To the no longer prodigal is the lavish love coming after repentance
			* It would have be easy to presume that the consequences of the prodigal made were the just response
			* But instead, the father offers the choicest of all that there is to offer, without a single hesitation.
		* To the elder son, there is a work of love as well
			* It seems like he understands himself as well - he works hard, and now he feels like that's worth something!
			* And so now, he is quite unrepentant - he wants what's his!
			* And moreover, he doubles down on his brother - there's literally no mention earlier in the text that his reckless spending was in prostitution.  That's his addition to the story.
			* The response from the father is just a loving as to the no-longer prodigal, but different
				* It was a gentle reminder that while yes, he has much, it is not just his alone.  "All that is mine is yours" means that it is still the fathers, and not just the son's.
				* It's also a reminder that resurrection is worth something great.
				* This should beg a question for us here amidst this second work of love: what is the elder son blinded to, in order for him to no longer be lost?
				* More on the nose perhaps, this is the question for many of us who feel as if we have lived and been blessed with the good life, especially as we may put our celebration on those who we see as squanders. 
					* Why should we celebrate the sobriety of the addict when we've stayed clean? 
					* Why should we provide for the squanderers when we've worked hard?
					* Why should we rejoice the marginalized when we've been at the center?
					* We're reminded that none of what we work for is all ours, and we see that we might have equal repentance to reflect on as well.
					* To not do so means we just stare and the puzzle box with the pile elsewhere and wonder why it doesn't look the same.
* But what if we put the puzzle together?  What if we did all the work?
	* The liturgical assembly is never just what it appears to be.  It also points to the eschatological reality beyond itself, to the purpose of God in Christ for the world and its people, for the whole created order.  This is what it means to call the liturgical assembly symbolic.
