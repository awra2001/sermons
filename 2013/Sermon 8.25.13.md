Jeremiah 1:4-10 [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Jeremiah/Jer 1]]

4 Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
and before you were born I consecrated you;
I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”

6 Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth.” 7 But the Lord said to me,

“Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;
for to all to whom I send you, you shall go,
and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
8 Do not be afraid of them,
for I am with you to deliver you,
declares the Lord.”

9 Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me,

“Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
10 See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms,
to pluck up and to break down,
to destroy and to overthrow,
to build and to plant.”

Luke 13:10-17 [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Luke/Luke 13]]
10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. 11 And behold, there was a woman who had had a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your disability.” 13 And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. 14 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, “There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.” 15 Then the Lord answered him,“You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? 16 And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?” 17 As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame, andall the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.

TSWBAT: Connect the need to serve others unabashedly when it's needed, not when he/she finds it convenient, like Jesus.  The concern is not the how, but simply to be available.

Jeremiah 1:4-10
Luke 13:10-17

I.               Introduction
a.     It is no stretch of the imagination to recognize that we are at a crossroads at our church.  As we move from summer into Autumn, so do we move towards the end of our transition into hopefully soon a time of stability when we welcome a new pastor to the pulpit. 
b.     Until that time comes, however, I think it’s good for all of us to take stock of what we are doing.  Our new pastor’s is coming, and we should probably shine our shoes, even out our ties, and make sure the laundry is put away where it belongs.
c.     Hopefully, many of these things aren’t new ideas, but just the things that occasionally we remind ourselves about and center ourselves.  The type of disciplines that matter.
II.              Luke 13:10-17
a.     Take a moment, and close all your eyes, and imagine the scene (WALK THROUGH THE SCENE)
                                               i.     The woman, bent over.  We imagine that she should be tormented by arthritis or osteoporosis or something, which has caused her stature to become bent and for her body to become frail.
                                             ii.     Imagine Jesus.  He notices the woman and immediately senses that she is in pain.  He would have been acutely aware of the law, and still felt it was better to provide care.
                                            iii.     Imagine for a moment if you were the woman now made straight?  How would you feel?  Would you exclaim?  Would your eyes fill with tears? 
                                            iv.     And, then, finally, imagine sitting on the sides listening to the argument between the ruler and Jesus.  The ruler knows his law, but Jesus pushes back to say that it’s permitted for everyone to care for their animals and whatever day, but yet the sons and daughters of the same tribe of Abraham must wait until human-dictated edicts deemed it beneficial.  Depending on your personal perspective, it would be easy to fall on either side of the debate.
b.     So what would have happened if Jesus wasn’t there?  Or if, for some reason, he didn’t feel like doing what he did?
                                               i.     Woman would have left still broken
                                             ii.     The law would have continue to prevail
                                            iii.     No one would have “rejoiced at all the glorious things done”
                                            iv.     Injustice by omission would have prevailed.
c.     I believe we far too often put Jesus at the sidelines or out of the church because we are far more comfortable with the system and its rules, all too often at the expense of those hurting the most.
                                               i.     Not something I speak out of in the hypothetical: Story of my first time at Boulevard
1.     Just moved to Columbus
2.     Wanted to feel connected to community
3.     Had my own hunched back issues
4.     I came and went for weeks on end, wanting to connect – I was a campus minister I had gifts to bring, but the system made it difficult for me to participate
5.     I left, but returned because I had someone reach out to me.
6.     Now I’m an elder, I teach and preach.  And I’m not that unusual.
                                             ii.     I’m only one story, but how many folks walk in and out these doors weekly hoping that today may be the day they no longer have to carry their burden but leave empty handed?
d.     I believe that at times as Presbyterians we allow our desire for order overshadow the real and pressing need to work to heal our friends, our families, and our communities.  We become the rulers who forget our commitment to the pain of our brothers and sisters, and become easily shamed and embarssed by Jesus’ truth – that we are very willing to do the things that are convenient and make sense to us, but not always the things that mean the most.
e.     As we wait with anticipation for our new pastor, I ask that we all take stock of where we place our emphasis – on our books of order (PCUSA or otherwise) and our systems we’ve built with our own hands, or on Christ and his gospel, which is a radical departure from status quo?
                                               i.     Do we depend on the same group of people to do things in our congregation when there are others who want nothing more than to belong?  Or do we reach out to the person next to us and learn their stories and gifts?
                                             ii.     Do we miss out on opportunities to present the sacraments as special and real parts of every day life because we force ourselves to fit into the mold of “this is how it’s always been” or do we continue to test our mores against the gospel?
                                            iii.     Do we miss out on giving of our gifts of dollar and time because we obligate ourselves to a percentage that deep down we know we’ll never achieve so we do nothing?
f.      Jeremiah 1:4-10
                                               i.     I know many of you are probably saying “well, this is all well and good, but I don’t know where to start”.
                                             ii.     Same with Jeremiah.  His age made him believe he could contribute nothing.  But God promises to be by his side no matter what.
                                            iii.     We can easily replace the words “speak” and “youth” with the things that stop us from breaking through our own systems.
                                            iv.     This world, which screams and strains in agony from the bounds of brokenness, simply needs men and women who put their hand on that pain and say “I am here.  Jesus is here, and we will not leave until you the bonds are loosed”.
III.            Conclusion
a.     I speak today as prosecutor and defendant, and that I am as guilty of allowing the comfort of what I know and how I set my life to inhibit me from loving others when its needed most, and perhaps most damning, not help others in the process healing, reconciliation, and glorifying God.
b.     I firmly believe that if we expect to be a church that thrives in the years ahead, we have to all see where we also act more as ruler and guard against it, and bring others in along the way.
c.     When we do, this place community becomes a beacon of grace, mercy and hope for all who walk into our presence.  And that is no less than what Jesus would call us to be.
