# Sermon 3.10.13

II Cor 5:16-21
Luke 21:34-38

TSWBAT: Understand that this world, while unjust, can not be avoided, ignored, or joined.  Instead, it must be looked at straight in the face and reminded of the gospel truth – this can be done through many tools.

#justice #apocalypse [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/2 Corinthians/2 Cor 5]] [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Luke/Luke 21]]


1. The glitz and the glamour
2. The not-so glitzy and glamorous
3. Fixed rents @ $1800/mo
4. Middle class folks who had good jobs chose to eat at the kitchen because it was better than not having the resources to eat at all
5. This kind of injustice was frustrating to me!

2. LouAnn
	1. Friday - ready to leave - always when you get "that call" - the one that'll keep you for an hour later than you want
	2. Listened for an hour to such a difficult story
	3. PTSD, Mental Health Issues, son with mental health issues and alcoholic… has hardly been out of the house since November
	4. She asked me if I was a Christian, and what do I think about God in these circumstances - every time she thinks she's getting somewhere there's a setback, and how could God let something like this happen?
3. These kind of stories, however, aren’t unusual
	1. Every time we pray together, these kind of stories – personal and corporate – weave into the stories of hope.
4. In the passage leading up to the gospel lesson, Jesus reminds us that the present day was not always going to be easy.

1. Jesus was giving the description of the end times, along with the destruction of the temple.
	1. ****EARTHQUAKES, FAMINES, PESTILENCES**** : Natural Upheaval
	2. ****WARS AND REVOLUTIONS:**** cultural upheaval
	3. ****BETRAYL, FAMILY TURNING AGAINST ITSELF:**** Personal Upheaval
	4. ****These are all things we see now (discuss each accordingly)****
2. While this may be difficult to have to process at times, it is refreshing to know that Jesus is honest about how things may be.

1. This world is not worth saving, and so why care?
2. We fill the lifeboat as best we can, or
3. We can numb ourselves to the realities and hide from the world – become drunk (Greek mentions the “giddiness” of wine)

1. Cavorting
2. This world is not worth saving, and so why care?
3. If the ship is going down, I may as well get in the first class section for a little and live it up
4. This is easy to do – especially if the frustration of the world becomes overwhelming.

1. The anxieties of life can weight us down to the point that the world looks too big, too scary, too much to care about

1. We are _invited_ to be a part of a redeeming work through Christ who “became sin” on our behalf
2. In spite of its troubles, this world is still being renewed by Christ, as we are being renewed and restored
3. **_We can look at the hurt, the brokenness, war, famine, and betrayl in the face and say “My brother, my sister, you are loved beyond measure, and you are made for more than you know.”_**
4. This is the most distilled gospel truth – the love of Christ beyond what we deserve or understand, fully available.
	1. Watching – there are places in this world (the person seated beside you, the one at work, the one down the street or around the world) who needs to hear this message (or feel this message)
	2. Pray – By continuing to connect to God through conversation and people through thought, we continue to see this world as something to care about, not something put “out of thought, out of mind”
	3. Rest – Perhaps one of the most underappreciated parts of ministry, if we cannot walk away (as Jesus does himself) to recollect and recharge, we find ourselves exhausted and unable to stand

5. While it’s easy to assume that this is adversarial relationship between us and the evil this world faces, what is more important is the gospel truth to those who are directly affected by “the present time” – the folks who hunger as they fall asleep, the folks who have had close loved ones abandon them, those who watch those around them fight and die for causes that only will lead to more hurt.
6. Close: "Hang On In There": Mike James Kirkland (1972) Response to the injustice of the segregated south, and the fight for civil rights - clearly something that would categorize as evil.  Kirkland sings the gospel in this song:
	There ain't no time,
	No time for sorrow.
	And we ain't got time no time
	Ah time to be sad.
	And maybe the world ain't what it could be
	But to understand why is to know reality
	Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
	Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)
	How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?
	Say oh child I never had it so good
	I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start
	Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could
	I'm just a part of your dreams this I know
	But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow.
	Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
	I said hang on (hang on in there)
	Ah now say tomorrow you woke up a king
	Now tell me just how would you fix everything?
	You walk around complaining about how things are
	But what have you added to this world so far
	Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
	And tell me how much did you give
	Ah don't give in (hang on in there)
	I said hang on (hang on in there)
	There are plenty of things still left to live for
	A child, a friend, and a wife
	They all want to share your life.
	Ain't that enough to make you want hang on
	Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)
7. We can say to them – and I can say to you – that you are loved by a three-in-one-God who sacrificed himself for you.  That love is open, free, and available with no strings attached.  As we walk through Lent, let us take this to heart, and to remind others of the same.  Amen.
