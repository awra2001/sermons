"Hope is combustible," the man said, almost as a chant, as he tapped the date on his calendar.

Seventeen years.  That's how long he had been married.  He thought a lot about that year, remembering when he was that age: can't smoke, can't drink, can't vote, can't enlist, just about as adult as one can be while still being all adolescent.  No one celebrates a 17th birthday: you remember just enough of your 13th and strain towards your 18th.

Marriage, it seemed to him, felt about the same.  No one celebrates 17 years.  It is a just simply a point along the path.

He often thought about marriage as a ship.  The first few years are in safe harbor, surrounded by supports.  At some point, however, the ship is launched onto the open sea.  Yes, there is an end goal - someplace to find harbor in a 25th year, or a 50th year.  But here, at 17, it felt like all was horizons of empty blue, moving in a direction that wasn't quite aimless, but certainly wasn't mapped.

"Hope is combustible."  In this wandering blip of space, he felt the volatility of hope buffet him.  It wasn't as though he and his spouse had any major storms that brought them together, nor were there always a strong wind to keep them going.  Their route, for better or for worse, just was.  Pedestrian, plain, unremarkable.

Which was precisely why hope became unstable.  He, as he knew his spouse did, had ideas of what a marriage would be like: children, a home, a picket fence.  And, yes, those happened in their due order - islands along their journey.  Even still, with the passage of every year, the ideas that seemed so bright and gleaming now showed their luster lost.  Kids are wonderful until you have to be a parent.  A home is great until you need to repair it.  And a picket fence feels less and less like an invitation to dwell within and more like the bars of a self-imposed prisonâ€”seventeen years of measuring his life out in coffee spoons.

"Hope is combustible," and he was beginning to feel as though his hope would explode to despair, disdain, disgust.  He wondered if it would take the ship down in a contemptuous fireball somewhere even before the 20-year mark - was it his spouse's lack of response?  His children's shortcomings?  The same stupid circuit breaker that never could get fixed?  What was it going to be that finally take it all down?

Yet, as he continued to tap upon the date, hear the word hope, he wondered about this fuel.  How could it be directed towards not destroying but propelling the ship?  The only difference, it seemed, between gasoline that was functional and gasoline that was dangerous was its container.  So he thought of a tank to store his hope.

He thought about the future - of the fullness of the safe harbor of the journey traveled long together.

He thought of the past - of the fullness of the safe harbor of journey just beginning.

He wondered if he could create a safe harbor in the present.

It wasn't exciting, but it was deliberate: he began to treat his spouse as he did when they first were dating.  He worked to create a little bit of the world he hoped for in the future.  He started down the to-do list.  He did laundry, and he hated laundry.  But over time, little by little, he saw he found satisfaction in all of it.  And over time, he found himself simply doing it for the sake of doing it.  The future story and the past remembrances bent themselves into a vessel for hope to glow.  The circuit breaker still tripped, God love it.  But as he tried again, and again, and again, he anticipated success in another meaningful effort.  Hope stabilized in him, and as it began to combust, it propelled his spirit.  

And the man realized that in the end, the safe harbor was there all along.  The 17th year was as good as the first, as the 12th, as the 35th and the 50th, God willing.  In the end, it wasn't about everyone else around him... but it was his hope he needed to hold and care for. 

The man chooses to do the mundane.  He thinks about the future, and then remembers the past.  So he bends both into the present.

Friends, hope finds its stability in anticipation - which is such a unique and beautiful part of how we were created.  It's our God-given gift of bringing future and past brought together in the present.  Alfred North Whitehead, a philosopher turned theologian, wrote that "immediate experience requires the insertion of the future in the crannies of the present." In anticipating the future, we rethink the past, and reform the present.

And in Advent, perhaps more than any other season, we're invited to stuff the crannies of the present full of what's the come - of promises that we know will be fulfilled, moving along the liturgical year through time, creating again the spiral of our shared communal life together.

We hear this throughout the text today, themselves a story of anticipation.

We hear the words of Jeremiah inserting the future into the crannies of the present for the people: there will be a day, says Adonai, when one will come to fulfill the promise.  A messiah will arise - the ship of God's people will find its safe harbor.  

But we know those words were spoken millennia ago.  And as each year goes on without safe harbor, it's easy to allow what once was a future hope based on the promises of the past to become despair, contempt.  We can so often feel as though we are caught in the adolescent stage of our faith - almost finding the horizon, yet only finding more and more empty blue sea.

I think that's why Jesus speaks how he does in Luke.  Jesus speaks of apocalypse - which seems frightful, but only for those who have lulled themselves into drunkenness - perhaps of despair or even of just blithe ignorance.  Either way, hope will combust, leaving them unprepared for the return - incarnation, resurrection, restoration - all coming together.  So instead of looking to the sky, or at their feet, Jesus proposes to cast their gaze to, of all things, a bunch of trees.  Place the future that is promised into the crannies of now - pay attention to the present.  Be about the work of today, even if it's no more excited as leaves blowing in the wind.  Allow what may combust in you in such a way that will lead to a drunken hangover (which, come to find, is the more direct Greek translation of 'dissipation' - crapula.) instead become what invites you to bring those promises into the movements of now: finding the gift of God enfleshed into every single mundane space possible.   Because there becomes the home for hope to be preserved and catalyzed.

So I wonder, in this Advent, where is the laundry that needs done for the sake of being done?  What fences need mended?  What might it be like to place the future into the crannies of everyone's hearts?  I mean, when was the last time you just gave a hug to someone for the sake of giving a hug?  Tell someone you appreciate and love them?  It's there friends that we create a space for hope to fuel us through Advent and beyond.  Thanks be to God.
