[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 20]]

- Doubt, and passages like today's are often one's handled at objective distance.
	- It's easier, often times, to look at it as an idea.  To wrestle with it directly means being a bit more vulnerable.
	- When we do that, we look at Thomas as something outside what we'd normally do.  
	- And that's always the hard part of passages that can hit close to home.  The more we look at it as objective, the less we see it as something that might affect us, too.
	- Clergy often use this to good effect - there is a layer that helps us to be in the difficult parts of one another's lives: to be too vulnerable can be unhealthy, just as being not vulnerable enough.
- So it's a risk to share, but perhaps more than any other time, I found today's gospel to hit right at home for me.
- So many of us clergy got through Sunday on a bit of a high - we saw pews fuller, seeing people that we've not seeing in awhile, and more importantly, at our best, we allowed the resurrection to inhabit our hearts.  I was humming "Don't Stop Belevin'" all week.
	- And, as is custom, we take the week after Easter as a quiet week - the staff recollect themselves.
	- I used it as a moment to head to Camp Montgomery for some study and some writing time.
	- As I'm working on Wednesday, I received a message from our Board of Pensions.
	- In it, it said that they were planning on reworking the entire benefits plan for clergy.
	- The video from the president of BoP began by saying that 40 years ago, when it was designed primarily for families, is a product of a outdated system, and it's time for some changes.
	- These changes include that in order to have a family on medical insurance, it would cost upwards of an additional $20,000, in addition to the amount that would will be charged to maintain my own insurance.
	- When you add that all up, it becomes a scary proposition for clergy, as well as the feeling they have for their churches.
		- Almost every day, we see articles come from the denominational media talking about how churches are in decline
		- It almost feels sometimes that there's a foregone conclusion - the PCUSA is collapsing, and a bright future of any type is in doubt.
	- And for me, perhaps more than anything, these changes felt like a little bit a betrayal.
		- Many of us left other jobs, committed to a sense of call
		- And what we felt in return was a tacit agreement that in the midst of things, what we could trust was that in service of ministry, the denomination would care for us and our families - one less thing for us to be concerned about so that we could tend to the care of our communities we love so much.
		- But not only might this feel like a betrayal of us, but then to imagine the pressure that might go for many churches is scary too.  Of course, never mind the fact that the directors of the BoP who make these decisions make 5-10x the median salary of PCUSA pastors.
		- And while it may mean that there are some silver linings - some of our staff might finally be able to receive some insurance at a far more affordable cost, the truth is for their families, it doesn't help.  So the hope is that folks might have other jobs to carry insurance, or that churches, already perhaps struggling a little to meet their budgets, face a lot of risk.
- Again, this is a bit more behind-the-curtain than usual.
	- Because I'd rather not show too often the sausage making factory that happens in churches, nor always show how it affects me.
	- But this week, I was angry, I was hurt, I was scared.  It made me wonder how truly possible it is to spend a career in ministry.  Sure there's a good retirement plan, but will I make it long enough to enjoy it in full?
	- And funny enough, earlier in the week I was talking to Lindsey and had said how I started to dream about a long term pastorate - seeing a generation grow: what it would be like to send the children I baptize off to college?  To marry them!
	- Because here's the truth: my story this week is not a whole lot different than so many of you.  Some of you might feel sympathy right now, but still others might feel cynical.  You might be saying "yeah, but at least you *have* insurance."
	- And all of this leads us to John today - doubt is real, it affects us.
- And so oh my gosh did I start to wonder about our friend Thomas.
	- I'm trying to imagine the interceding week between the disciples and Thomas.
	- The rest of them were just apparently at the right place at the right time.  Who knows what was happening with Thomas... we're not given that information.  He could have been running errands, doing the work.  In the midst of the tragedy of Jesus's death, perhaps he was looking to busy himself.
	- Then, I'm sure, the news came: Jesus came to them.  What thoughts must have raced through his head?  Anger, betrayal, cynicism?  It's not a far stretch to imagine all the above.  He could have been furious at the other disciples: how are they so special and different than him?
		- Had he given into those feelings, we can imagine a far different ending to this story.  Thomas could have quit.  He could have walked away.  
		- The disciples, too, could have held a new opinion of Thomas - maybe he didn't earn the right to see Jesus.
		- This is what doubt can do when taken to its very end.  When our skepticism causes us to undermine the very foundations of our what we believe, we can choose to reject it all.  That in the end, it's better to knock out the foundations and let it all crumble.  And it radiates out to the community.  We can question one another - doubt one part of the foundation, doubt it all.
		- Maybe Thomas was there - maybe Thomas saw the whole Jesus thing as a lie.  He needed the proof.  And even still, this could have been rhetorical - an unjustifiable retort.  
	- But still, curiously, he shows up.  That seems to always been an underappreciated part of this text.  In the midst of the doubt, Thomas continues.  He goes back.  He's welcomed in with the rest of the disciples, in an enclosed space.  In the midst of all of the realities of the cracks in what Thomas might or might not believe truly at this point, he goes back.  They still need each other.
	- And there, in that decision to go back, Jesus is there.
		- And interesting enough too, both Jesus and Thomas don't hold back.  Jesus could have lectured him: don't you have enough faith to see through this earlier disappointment?  But instead he offers the proof.
		- Thomas, for his part, could have made up his mind enough too that it wasn't worth the effort: too far gone, too far depleted in hope.  But instead, he reaches out as well.
		- Now, of course, Jesus commends those who don't see and believe, but perhaps in the midst of the previous week, this is less critique than encouragement.  That hope and faith can give a way through doubt.  That none of these feelings are permanent, but fluid: it's not that they didn't need the proof, but that this proof will not last forever.  Take it, and continue on: those after need to hear the stories of hope and bind them to their hearts.  There is a blessing there.
		- But all of it - from Thomas to Jesus to all those who come after - requires the action.  That we cannot sit in the closed room forever touching promise.  That sometimes we won't be where the proof is.  That when we're not, we seek the hope.
- Which all made me question what I should do in the week that follows.  What we should all do.
	- Because certainly, I felt the foundation crack.  I questioned my sense of call.  That I, too, should give into decline, disarray, and death.
	- But should I - or any of us do that - what we lose is the chance to take one more opportunity to see if Jesus is there.  And while he might not be there physically, the stories of his faithfulness persist.
	- After all, we just literally talked about this miracle of resurrection, and it is everywhere.  It was here Sunday.  It's here in each of you.  It's in the way people are loved and cared for, in the journey to recapture hope.  Perhaps then, doubt is just atrophied hope, not allowed to strengthen through the labor of the journey.
	- Who am I, after all, to assume that somehow, things won't work out?  Who am I to even assume that this isn't part of what the call on my life ultimately is?  That there may be other things.  Or, that the God's Kingdom here doesn't require the hard work of justice for care for all?  How can I do anything else but then go find Jesus again in the upper room?  Or down the street? 
	- And there's the good news, dear siblings - that Jesus will not withhold himself should we keep going.  That yes, all of the feelings of an all consuming doubt are real, but allowed to become static, it will create a moribund hope.  And then what's left?
	- Maybe this is you now.  If so, I'm glad you're here.  You're not alone.  I'm right there with you.  So let's keep going.  Let's not give in.  Let's see where resurrection will take us in the midst of not seeing it.  Let's make faith and hope as strong as we can.  Let's do the work that puts more muscle on the bone.  And then, dear friends, let us see where our risen Savior is then.  Perhaps, along the way, we'll discover that we didn't need touch his hands at all, but we came to believe... and what blessing that is.  TBTG.
