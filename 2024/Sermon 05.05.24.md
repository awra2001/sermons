- On Sunday, we ended service by singing "And They Will Know We Are Christians By Our Love"
	- It's a lovely song, and I remember mentioning that what a joy it would be to be known for our love, and perhaps only for our love.
	- That song envisions the result - a community of unity, side-by-side together
	- What it doesn't tell us though, is *how.* How is any community known by its love?
	- If we work backwards in our gospel text today, we can unfold the how of love.
- JOHN
	- Jesus lays out a set of commandments to his disciples so that they will love each other, and go and bear fruit - and not just any fruit, but a bounty that will last.  So clearly, this loving of each other has long term effects for those who receive it.  And certainly, and of us who have been truly loved by someone know its impact.  Really being loved by someone can completely reorient our lives - can literally save our lives.
	- And then, Jesus starts to lay out something different to us - that his disciples are not servants, but instead are friends.
	- It is within this friendship that love is enacted.
	- And how it is enacted, then, is by laying down one's life for one's friends.
	- So there you go!  They Will Know We Are Christians by laying down our life for our friends.
- Though the more we think about it, that probably doesn't really help us a whole lot either, does it?  I mean, sure, we can think of sacrifice in a literal sense, and yes, that heroism would certainly demonstrate love and friendship.  But the truth is we only will ever literally lay down our lives once.  And so if that's the case then the options to show that love as Christians is pretty small.
- As I thought about this week, one person came to mind in the last few years that exemplified this differently - Lenford "Lenny" Leonard
	- For those of you who don't know him, he is one of Homer Simpson's closest friends and work pal in the show the Simpsons.
	- And I couldn't stop thinking about an episode of the show in 2008.  The framing is that Lenny wins $50,000 on a lottery ticket (interestingly enough, a ticket that would have been won by Homer had he not been distracted by Bart)
	- This clip I'll show next is what Lenny decided to do with his winnings:

	- If you've ever bought a lottery ticket with the hopes of winning, I'm sure you've imagined the life you'd lead after
	- And here, Lenny gives that all up, in one fell swoop, in celebration of his friends.  
		- And, as funny as it sounds, lives here are changed.
			- What's interesting to me about who is in attendance at that event is that I don't remember is all my years of watching the Simpsons that Lenny was necessarily friends with all the people who were there.  While yes, I know that Barney and Homer and Lenny were all friends, I would not have said that Dr. Hibbert was friends with Lenny.  Yet he's valuable.  Others, like Duff Man, or even Rev. Lovejoy, are at best acquaintances.  But that didn't seem to matter for that night.  They were all equally treated to a joyful banquet, offered extravagant gifts (the gag becomes each recieve new robot vacuums - which in 2008 would have been quite a thing - and then Bart sets them all off and hilarity ensures for the rest of the episode), and valued for who they are.
			- Barney is cared for differently.  And listen, while I know it's meant to be a joke in part, there is something to be said that in Lenny's friendship, Barney will be able to care for his mom.
			- But also, Homer has a legitimate moment of reflection.  It seems clear that Homer would not have done the same had he won that ticket, so he sees that through Lenny's offering his winnings something could be different.  Lenny is known through his love.
- And so, this idea of being friends, of being known by love, of laying down one's life, is not as foreign or as hyperbolic as we may have it seem on first blush.  
	- We are known as Christians by our love, by our laying down our lives, by our friendships by being a little more like Lenny and a little less like Homer.
	- Being known by our love is being known for our lavish attendance to others - of celebrating their belonging to us even if they're not close.
	- It's opening up the spaces for honest reflection through who we are - of revealing the why we do.  Because of God's love made revealed by Jesus, we don't love out of obligation as if we were servants required to do a job.  Instead, we're offering to one another in friendship, which at the very core of the word itself in Greek is simply a term related to love, *phileo.*
	- And all of this is not about just the talking about, but the doing.  It would have been all well and good for Lenny to say he'd throw a party, but different still when he went out and did it.
- So how might we do this?
	- Well, it's great that today is a communion Sunday, because this table can be a place where we gather similarly at Christ's banquet table.
	- It's also in so many things we may have already done - underwear for people who are unable to have the dignity of that care.
	- But, as with many things, what will demonstrate the Christ's love to others is when it is no longer just the easy thing to do, but when it's practiced in total.  When it's all the winnings of the lottery that go to the banquet.
	- It will be the lavishing of love and friendship on the alcoholic, and the beer mascot.  It will be leaving nothing in reserve in the act of friendship.  Otherwise, it would far to easy to become fair-weathered in our friendship.  
	- But just as every friend of ours is different than others, so is every faith community's expression of love and friendship based on our gifts, our abilities, and our context.
	- So let us continue to give ourselves fully in the act of friendship and love.  Let's lay it all on the line, be the authentic friends.  Let's reflect the friendship Christ has with us!
