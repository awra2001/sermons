[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Mark/Mark 11]]

* Remember growing up seeing the older folks around me as superheroes.
	* There was nothing my dad couldn't repair.
	* My grandfather was this paragon of Christianity. 
	* As I got older, I saw that my superheroes were human.  My dad couldn't repair everything (although close).  My grandfather's understanding of faith and mine took different paths.
	* If I'm honest, I'm not excited for the day my children, or the children I work with see me as less superhero and more human, because it'll expose me. 
* There's something so decentering about that exposure.
	* For those of us who are having to reconcile the changes, we're having to contend with a new vulnerability
	* And maybe that person doesn't even realize it - they could just be living their lives, of course... but now we need to see them differently.
	* I find that as I'm heading squarely into middle age, I'm thinking about it still on both sides - that I have people who I still need to adjust my thoughts about, and that I'm someone who others may adjust their thoughts about.
	* It truly becomes more about us, and who we are. Our hearts have to reconcile who they are.
	* If we find a way to connect to their deeper heart - the lovely part of them without being a superhero, then we build a new and lasting relationship.
		* I'd like to think once my kids see the weaknesses in me, they'll also see that in spite of those how much I love them and the good that I do
		* I love my dad, and love my grandfather who has been a couple years passed now.
* Jesus as superhero
	* I think most of us imagine Jesus in part as this amazing superhero.  He's close enough to it.
	* Miracles, saving people, standing up for the little guy, bringing justice.
	* And here, we get this penultimate scene every year - he's heading into for what seems to be his final battle.
	* I want Jesus to be ultra warrior plus.  If Jerusalem is Thanos, I want The Avengers. 
	* I want power; I want it all to be overcome, and justice to reign.
* The decentering
	* It is quite striking that Jesus rides a donkey and not a horse or even a mule. In keeping with the instruction about a leadership of service in 10:41–45\*, Jesus does not ride a horse or in a chariot, as a Roman celebrating a triumph would. Nor does he ride a mule to recall the narrative about the succession of Solomon to the throne of David (1 Kgs 1:33\*).50 Rather, he rides a donkey that evokes both the royal tradition of Gen 49:11\* and the humility (or the gentle and benign exercise of power) of Zech 9:9\*.  Collins, A. Y., & Attridge, H. W. (2007). _[Mark: A Commentary on the Gospel of Mark](https://ref.ly/logosres/hrmneia62mk?ref=Bible.Mk11.2-3&off=1832&ctx=he+crowd+in+v.+10*.%0a~It+is+quite+striking)_ (p. 518). Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press.
		* Jesus comes on the literal opposite thing that the powerful superhero would.  He comes in peace.  He lives into what he said - an easy yoke.  A light burden.
		* And what did the people do?  They saw that this was the beginning of the end.  In Plutarch's (who is a contemporary of the writer of Mark) book of biographical sketches, he notes that "When the time of Cato’s military service came to an end, he was sent on his way, not with blessings, as is common, nor yet with praises, but with tears and insatiable embraces, the soldiers casting their cloaks down for him to walk upon, and kissing his hands, things which the Romans of that day rarely did, and only to a few of their imperators..." Collins, A. Y., & Attridge, H. W. (2007). _[Mark: A Commentary on the Gospel of Mark](https://ref.ly/logosres/hrmneia62mk?ref=Bible.Mk11.7-8&off=504&ctx=an+culture+as+well:%0a~When+the+time+of+Cat)_ (p. 519). Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press.  This is another clue that something's up.
	* And then, after all the pomp and circumstance, we end on this note at 11: Jesus and the disciples look around, and no one shows up.  No dignitaries.  Nothing.  They decide it's late, and they go home.  No one is crowned king.
	* For being a conquering, powerful King, he's not been all that impressive.
* Jesus is not the superhero we have made him.
	* I think this one of the biggest reasons why so many of us have to walk away from this faith.  And it may not be our own personal conception of Jesus, but the one we're raised with, maybe superhero Jesus.  Iron Man Jesus.
	* And when we have to deal with him not being that superhero, it's hard to expose the vulnerability on both sides.
	* We have to figure out what the new relationship is.
* But the hero he is in the new and lasting relationship is so much more.
	* As we talked about a couple weeks ago, it's not that Jesus is on a death mission.
	* But instead, he is willing to take this loving, involved, grace filled Kingdom and its fulfillment to the very limits.  That the peaceable Kingdom will come. 
	* In a moment where it could be most visible, he shows his dedication.  And there will be no retreat, even as he anguishes.
* While superhero Jesus is a figure that I can hold out as a figure, Palm Sunday Jesus is one that is intimate, and asks me to be intimate too. 
	* In this decentering reality where my own preconcieved notions are swept aside, I receive answers to questions I'm often too fearful to ask - am I worth loving?  Am I good enough?  Are those around me good enough?  Can I bring others so that they may hear those words as well? 
	* The answer reveals itself in the coming week: yes, you are, and you must care for those who have heard that they're not.
* Approaching this Holy Week, can we reimagine Jesus?
