[[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Exodus/Exod 3#1|Exod 3,1-15]] 
Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness and came to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God. 
There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed. 
Then Moses said, "I must turn aside and look at this great sight and see why the bush is not burned up." 
When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, "Moses, Moses!" And he said, "Here I am." 
Then he said, "Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground." 
He said further, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. 
Then the Lord said, "I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings, 
and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. 
Now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt." 
But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?" 
He said, "I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
But Moses said to God, "If I come to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?" 
God said to Moses, "I am who I am." He said further, "Thus you shall say to the Israelites, 'I am has sent me to you.' " 
God also said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the Israelites, 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you': This is my name forever, and this my title for all generations.

At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, "Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you." 
He said to them, "Go and tell that fox for me, 'Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work. 
Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.' 
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!

- Name the question
	- It's not about gender dynamics, but about a God who is who we thought
- Story telling - examples of the ways in which exclusively male language for God limited our ability to experience God as who we had been taught God can be
	- Jessica
	- Adam
- What these stories told us both is that, for some reason, the constructions that have been given to us about God might be insufficent
- It's not like we're afraid here of women who fit masculine tropes, or really vice versa.  But yet, inviting the same of God seems strange.
- EXO
	- Moses needed to know who God was and God's response is "I Am" - which is to say that I am more than you know or will ever need
	- God doesn't seem to play that game.  God is who God is.  And yes, Adonai is constructed masculine, but we need not forget that God simply is called by God's name.  What we humans have done with it is ultimately not of God's doing.
- Which might open us to the bigger issue here.
	- Are we afraid of many-gendered God?  Hell, a binary God?  A non-gendered God?
	- Or have we just painted ourselves into cultural corners that limit ourselves to just witness God as is?
	- When we limit, we can exclude the possiblities of seeing ourselves made in God's image.
	- When we apply the tropes, we now create judgments that were never really meant to be there, and we might miss the exact things we're made to be - mother hens, warriors, etc etc etc.
- We need a God bigger than what we imagine.  We need to let the name catch us.  Why shouldn't God's name stick out grammatically?  Be uncomfortable?  Each time we do, we remember it's not us making God in our image, but the other way around.

- In our language for God, we should always be seeking to speak of God (for ourselves and others) in ways that allow God to be bigger than us and our expectations. Our language should lean us into the mystery of God. So we have father and mother, lion and lamb, child and parent. The Bible gives us plenty of language for God that is both/and, not either/or, because it is always pointing to a God who is more, better, greater than we can expect or imagine.

I. Stories of limiting Gendered ideas of God
	A. Jessica's story - Jessica
	B. Adam's story - Adam
II. Name the question - Adam
	A. Is God who we thought God would be?
	B. In both the stories we told, limiting God kept us from experiencing the fullness of God's love and from knowing ourselves as fully made in God's image
III. Exodus - Naming God - Jessica
	A. In the Exodus story, Moses also needs to know if God is who he thought God, and he needed to be able to assure Israel that God is who they had been told God would be
	B. God refuses to give a limiting answer, choosing instead to name Godself as I AM, an ultimately untranslatable name - talk about expansiveness of God, mystery, etc.
IV. In our language for God, we need to pattern ourselves more after God in its expansiveness - Jessica
V. Luke - Adam
we need to allow ourselves to be gathered by our nurturing Mother Hen. Every time we limit our language for God, whether by gender or by something else, we drive a chick from the hen and risk not allowing that chick to be gathered as Christ longs.

**Jessica’s Story**

When my daughter was a newborn, I struggled. I was sleep-deprived, I was anxious about nursing, I was having trouble adjusting to this total shift in identity to mother, to the idea that someone was completely dependent on me. I did not fare well in those early weeks, and I desperately wanted to lay my burdens before God. I had been promised my whole life that God was enough, that God knew every experience, that there was no road I could walk that God would not walk with me. And so one of the hardest struggles of that season for me was the fact that I suddenly had trouble placing myself in God’s story, or trusting that this experience was one God understood. As a new mom, anxious and sleepless and overwhelmed, God seemed silent and distant and removed from my experience. You see, though I was comfortable using gender-neutral or feminine language for God, the language I had grown up with, and so the God-language of my heart, was masculine. It was God as a he, God our Father. And in those early days of motherhood, I could not relate to God our Father. After all, what did Father God know about the many ways I was being torn apart by motherhood?

In those early days, I was desperate to connect to an idea of God that spoke to me as a woman and as a mother, and when I could not do that, in a very un protestant move I asked Mary to stand in the gap. I recently ran across something I wrote when Emmy was about two months old:

I find myself envious of my Catholic sisters who have a whole vocabulary and tradition for praying to Mary. These days I also want to commune with Mary. Jesus may be fully human, but can he really know this experience? We celebrate the particularity of his incarnation, his maleness being essential to his God-with-ness; what can he know about mothering? But Mary knows.…And so in the early morning, before the sun rises, as I nurse and rock and sing to my baby, I cry to God, but I also cry to Mary. I cry to Mary, and Mary sees me. I cry to Mary, and Mary does not give me some trite answer about long days and short years. I cry to Mary, and Mary reminds me that mothering is holy work of the Kingdom. I cry to Mary, and Mary whispers back to me, “Emmanuel, God is with you, in the precious babe in your arms.” 

I can look back now and see it was always God sitting with me in the wee hours, but in the moments I needed it most, my grasp of who God is fell short because the way I had been taught to speak of God was too small. Slowly, slowly, and with great patience on God’s part if not on mine, God reminded me of the traditions in Scripture and in the church’s history that provides metaphors for God as a woman and a mother. In fact, the book I read with the children was gifted to me in those early months, and I wept the first time I read it to meet the God I had been longing for in its pages. Father God shepherded me faithfully for the first 30 plus year so my life, but in the depths of new motherhood, it was Mother God who rescued me.

**Adam’s Story**
- It's easy to think, then, that because the masculine God is the one that dominates our faith, that it's means for boys and men, it gives us a leg up.  We witness a God in our image
- But as is so often the case, we start to become reductionistic.
- Wild At Heart
	- "The heart of a man is undomesticated, wild at its core. It yearns for adventure, for a battle to fight, and a beauty to rescue. It's not content with the mundane, the routine, the safe. It seeks the thrill of the unknown, the excitement of exploration, the challenge of the uncharted. It's not satisfied with being a mere spectator in life's grand drama – it wants to be the hero, the protagonist, the one who charges the castle, slays the giant, and rescues the damsel in distress."
	- That was my college experience.  I taught Wild at Heart with my fraternity.  But that never quite made sense to me.  What was described as "authentic masculinity" because it was God's design for us never quite fit me.  A guy that was always saw himself first as a husband and father, building a home.
	- More than anything, it obscured what I knew in myself was always big feelings.  That an authentic man didn't seem to cry, didn't seem to be moved by art or by tenderness.  Instead, it was conquest.
- But, underneath it all, I thought this was apparently God.  
- It wasn't until much later, in seminary, that things started to change:
	- The Will To Change: that we societally live by a patriarchial system that values anger, but, as bell hooks writes: "“Something missing within” was a self-description I heard from many men as I went around our nation talking about love. Again and again a man would tell me about early childhood feelings of emotional exuberance, of unrepressed joy, of feeling connected to life and to other people, and then a rupture happened, a disconnect, and that feeling of being loved, of being embraced, was gone. Somehow the test of manhood, men told me, was the willingness to accept this loss, to not speak it even in private grief. Sadly, tragically, these men in great numbers were remembering a primal moment of heartbreak and heartache: the moment that they were compelled to give up their right to feel, to love, in order to take their place as patriarchal men."
	- All of my feelings of a ultra masculine, definined in this patriarchial lens, made me bury the gentle heart - after all, I wanted to be faithful.  I only realized it during my time in residency in chaplaincy where, as I was talking to a director, he stopped me in a discussion and said "you feel big feelings, don't you?"  To which, a little stunned, I replied "yep, I do."  He challenged me further by saying "you know, sometimes people don't want to hear you think.  They want to feel your feelings.  It's okay to cry."
	- Those two events, in short succession, suddenly blew open a new space - perhaps God wasn't the Wild At Heart God alone.  Maybe that was just acquiencesence. 

**Naming the Question – Adam**
- As Jessica and I told these stories to each other in preparation for today, one thing became clear: is God who we thought God was?  Was God the God we were raised to believe?  
- And maybe just as important - if the God we were told about wasn't completely accurate, then maybe that incomplete God was actually more hurtful than helpful.
- Both of us, for better or for worse, had missed a God that opened our hearts.

**Exodus: Naming God – Jessica**

In our story from Exodus 3, we find Moses asking similar questions of God as Adam and I did. When he encounters God in the burning bush, and when God sends him to lead God’s people out of Egypt, he essentially asks: who are you, God? Are you the God I think you are? Will you be the God I need, and the people of Israel need, in this moment?

Moses is not thrilled about what God is asking of him. He does not want to go back to Egypt – he left because he murdered someone. His allegiances in God’s great rescue plan are honestly probably a little up in the air – he is a Hebrew but he was raised in Pharoah’s household, and he hasn’t lived there for 40 years. So he presses God for a name – if I’m going to show up and do this, I want to know whose bidding I’m doing. Who are you, God in the burning bush? Give me a name that will inspire me to get on board with this crazy plan. Give me a name that tells me you are the God for this moment. I imagine Moses is hoping for something like, “I am God the Great Liberator.” Or maybe even “I am God of wind and flame.” Like, he can work with that – that’ll do for this wild rescue the people from Egypt idea.

God, though, refuses to play Moses’ game. God had already opened the conversation by flashing ID – “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And so at this point in the conversation, God essentially gives Moses two names that build on that theme. The first usually gets translated as “I am who I am” or “I will be who I will be,” although some present-day scholars consider it essentially untranslatable, but however you want to try to bring it into English, it is meant to emphasize God’s sustained state of being: God is who God was and is and will be. This is God basically saying that any name we give will fall short – it can only ever speak to one part of who God is, never the whole.

And the second name God gives is truly untranslatable. You will often hear pastors and scholars say Yahweh; in our English bibles it gets translated as Lord with small caps, which is a nod to an ancient Hebrew tradition which swaps out this most holy name for God with the Hebrew Adonai, meaning Lord. For generations, millenia it was considered too holy to speak aloud, and so we have lost a sense of how it would truly be pronounced, though it is peppered throughout our Bibles. And again, I don’t think this is God being difficult or deliberately mysterious. I think this is God simply acknowledging that our human language is inadequate for the task of naming God.

**Expansive language for God – Jessica**

And so Moses asks God’s name, and this is what we get – I Am. It’s a little unsatisfying. And yet that is certainly not Scripture’s only or last word on the many things God is called. The pages of Scripture are overflowing with names and images for God. I have a full two-page, 3 columns per page list with over 130 from one of my seminary classes, and I am sure it is incomplete. The words God uses to describe Godself are expansive. They are designed to blow up our mental boxes about who God is. Yet we want to stick to a couple and conceive our whole idea of God based on our pet names.

Pastor Lauren Winner, in her book _Wearing God_, talks about this very problem. She writes about how her church tends to have four or five favorite metaphors for God, saying “ ‘Shepherd’ and ‘light’  are perfectly wonderful images, but in fixing on them – in fixing on any three or four primary metaphors for God – we have truncated our relationship with the divine, and we have cut ourselves off from the more voluble and variable witness of the Scriptures, which depict God as clothing. As fire. As comedian. Sleeper. Water. Dog…The Bible’s inclusion of so many figures for God is both an invitation and a caution. The invitation is to discovery: discovery of who God is, and what our friendship with God might become. The caution is against assuming that any one image of God, whatever truth it holds, adequately describes God.”

So when we talk about God and gender, we are really asking a question about the language we use for God, what that opens us to, and what that closes us off from. God is who God is who God is. Our language for God cannot change that. When God reveals God’s name to Moses, it seems to me that God is taking the option of God-language that opens, rather than closes off. And so when we think about gendered language for God, we have to remember that God is neither male nor female, but that we might learn something new about God if we can use names and images that borrow from both the masculine and the feminine, just as we might learn something new when we consider God as both parent and child, as both bread and cup, as both flame and water. None of these change who God is, but they may open us to new ways of experiencing God who is beyond our comprehension and imagination.

**Luke** **– Adam**
*we need to allow ourselves to be gathered by our nurturing Mother Hen. Every time we limit our language for God, whether by gender or by something else, we drive a chick from the hen and risk not allowing that chick to be gathered as Christ longs.*
- Jesus himself shows how there is a God beyond in his own actions.
- On a surface level, we see this juxtaposition of masculine and feminine: Jesus's lament about Jerusalem leads him not to stereotypical responses - in fact, he calls out that type of anger and violence.  Instead, his response is to lovingly gather as a mother bird would gather her chicks under her wing.
- This is not a typical response in how a prophet or priest would be described in the text, and so it ought to strike us.
- But what's particularly interesting here in Luke is *why* Jesus is moved to this.  It's all brought out from the care work he's performing - he's healing people, nursing them.  As the world has continued to fall and cry out, here is Jesus bringing them into a loving embrace.  Holding them, attending to their wounds.
- And that resistance to love, resistance to healing leads him to "Jerusalem, Jerusalem..." a phrase deeply freighted with compassion and affection.
- What we see here then is again, a God who opens up.  A God who is seeking.
- For both Jessica and me, we found that by looking for an open, expansive God, what we both found was the Jesus who bound our wounds, who gathered us into love.  I wonder what might have happened to each of us had we not found this God beyond, God-of-the-I-AM and only I AM. Would we still be closed off, out beyond Christ's wings?  Would we be throwing stones?  Would Jessica not find a God who mothers?  Would have not find a God of heart?  
- That's frightening for me to think about, in part for my own heart, but also for so many others who sit with a story of God spoken in too simple language too quick to forge in our image.
- Because it would seem, knowingly or not, when we limit our language for God, we inevitably limit others from being gathered - or worse, drive them away.  Jesus's heartfelt lament is also to us - oh my church, my church, a people who drive my beloved away because your God is too small.  
- The question for us then, is are we willing?  Willing to be as expansive as we can be?
