“And he began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again. And he made this declaration frankly. And, taking hold of him, Peter began to admonish him. But he, turning about and looking at his disciples, admonished Peter and says, “Get behind me, Accuser, because you think not the things of God but those of men.” And summoning the crowd along with his disciples he said to them, “If anyone wishes to come along behind me, let him deny himself utterly and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wishes to save his soul will lose it; but whoever will lose his soul for the sake of me and of the good tidings will save it. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole cosmos and to forfeit his soul? For what might a man give in exchange for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him too will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”

[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Mark/Mark 8]]
- Isn't it strange that in order to realize all the covenantal promises God gives Abram, he needs to change his name?  For 99 years, he's been called one thing: Abram.  
- And while our names don't entirely define us, we do get used to a certain way that our lives go with a name.
	- We respond to a name being called
	- We indicate much of what we are and what we own through our name
		- When we're young and our parents scrawl out our names on all of our school materials - we know that we own those things.
		- And over time, all the places where our names are marked start to tell our story.  If you've started a business and your name is own the sign up front, it is a sign of your work.  Diplomas, employee records, attendance cards - our names showing up reveal our lives.
	- So to suddenly have a name change would be rather jarring.  
- I've always understood that part of the "why" here is that God is now reflecting the change in office of both Abram and Sarai - and certainly, God's conversation with them can lead us to be there.  But in my studies this week I've come to find that the Hebrew itself doesn't quite give us that easy of an answer.  It isn't just a "well, now we're changing your name because you're doing something new" moment.
- Which leads us to wonder what is in a name at all?
	- We're not the first ones to ask this question: think of Juliet as she pines for Romeo:
		- Tis but thy name that is my enemy;  
			Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.  
			What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,  
			Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part  
			Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!  
			What's in a name? That which we call a rose  
			By any other name would smell as sweet;  
			So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,  
			Retain that dear perfection which he owes  
			Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,  
			And for that name which is no part of thee  
			Take all myself.
	- Spoiler alert, Romeo and Juliet do not end up going away happily ever after.  So that name matters.  Tis but thy name that is my enemy, yes, but not just that: it's what the name does to a person: the enmity between the Montagues and Capulets that is the enemy, in part simply because of the name, but also for all that is attached to them both.
	- And maybe it doesn't change the nature of Romeo, as a rose might still smell sweet, but it does change how the families are.  The world is different because of a name.  So, sadly, Romeo cannot doff his name just that easily.
	- And even when a name changes, even at first it's about the response of the world changing, it will change us, too.
		- If a rose was not called a rose but a garbage stink fruit, you'd hesitate to take a smell.
		- And ask anyone who has taken up space in a pulpit like this before and after their ordination, and I'm fairly certain every single one will tell you that it is different once you have the Rev. title in front.  People will address you differently, yes, and it will also change you.
		- We approach someone different when they have letters in front of or behind their names, or what other names are attached to them.  Wealthy, poor, criminal, marginalized, etc.
- This is why Peter begins to rebuke Jesus.
	- The name Messiah at that moment would have meant power.  Oppressing the oppressors.  Liberating the people surrounding the disciples from all that they faced.
	- This was the rose, and instead, Jesus is naming his ministry more and more like a garbage stink fruit.  Who would want to follow a liberator that needs to undergo all sorts of suffering? And then to talk of resurrection, no less? 
	- And Jesus responds - you are setting your mind not on divine things, but on human things.
		- Here's the turn: all that's in a name - how we respond, how it changes us - is very human.  If God creates what we call a "rose" a "rose" and we call it a garbage stink flower, well, it's still going to be a rose.  
		- Jesus is separating what matters with what doesn't.
- Jesus then turns to each of us in the crowds and disciples, and asks us about a name change as well.  Are we willing to be cross-bearers?  And here, finally, we start to find how we start to weave what is in a name together.
	- This is our Abram and Sarai moment.  We are offered a multitude of blessings - literally the saving of our souls: the very essence of who we are.  But to do so, we have to give up what we've been.  We have to be willing to be called by a new name.
	- The new name of cross-bearer changes our orientation towards the world. It means we are putting our minds towards the God things and not the human things.  It's no longer the battles along names, whatever they might be, but instead to be aware of the suffering of the world and to work towards its redemption.
- That, like Abram to Abraham at 99, is jarring.  We are happy to distinguish between our roses and garbage stink flowers; we are happy to sit warring our Montagues and Capulets.  To change our names is to let go of everything society reckons of value.  It is no wonder that we may so often reach the threshhold of being willing to take up a new name and, upon looking at the requirements, are happy to recede into the battles that we know - we are Abram laughing at God for something so ludacris as birthing a culture - we are Juliet forever lamenting surnames.  In other words, the suffering you know is better than the suffering you don't.
- But, what we forfeit is nothing short of resurrection - life beyond death.  There's God-thought.  There is a rose by any name smelling sweet.  And when we all become cross-bearers, our surname is shared.  Do you want to love those different than you?  Do you want to imagine a world that is free from the dividing lines of humanity - that race, sex, sexual orientation, age, political affiliation, take your pick - are not what makes you who you are and who others are?  Claim the name cross-bearer.  Own the jarring moment of transition!  Believe in a soul-saving resurrection, even though it may seem to be worthy of a rebuke from folks who'd rather set their minds to human things.  
- In the end, I go back to the question I posed before Lent: what is the thing that gets in your way in ministry?  What is the thing you need Lent to help you let go of?  It may be, dear friends, that the thing that gets in our way the most is simply us.  Who we claim to be.  Let us then grow the courage in this thin time to let it go.  To be known by a new name.
