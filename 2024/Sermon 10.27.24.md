For there is no distinction, <br>since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; <br>they are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, <br>whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood, effective through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed; <br>it was to demonstrate at the present time his own righteousness, so that he is righteous and he justifies the one who has the faith of Jesus. <br>Then what becomes of boasting? It is excluded. Through what kind of law? That of works? No, rather through the law of faith. <br>For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law. <br>[[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#20]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#21]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#22]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#23]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#24]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#25]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#26]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#27]][[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Romans/Rom 3#28]] | [[_Resources/Bible/NRSVUE/Mark/Mark 10#46\|Mark 10,46-52]] <br>They came to Jericho.

- As I mentioned to the kids, one of my hobbies at one point in my life was to dig into my family tree.
	- I had a great uncle who had traced my dad's family back well into the 1600s, and I wanted to see what I could find with the benefit of new technology as well.
	- And it was a fascinating journey.  Almost every side of my family has been in North America since before the country's founding.  There are connections to the Mayflower, battling in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and my family almost all found their homes in the foothills of Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
	- One find in particular that was really fascinating was this picture from the original Selders homestead in Westmoreland County, PA... about 45 minutes outside Pittsburgh, right around the hometown of Mr. Rogers.  Here, since 1792 has stood a claim of my family.
	- I've never been there, and I've only seen it in pictures, but I found a lot of meaning in this stone - it meant that I had some legacy in this country, some heritage.
	- This is why we look into genealogy or even mark a Sunday like this.  We look to this Sunday as a chance to have an identity and allow it to shape us, even in some small part.
	- But to have it be truly valuable takes some extra work, especially to avoid the traps that ultimately can hurt us.
	- And so I want to offer a few points to consider for a Heritage Sunday, and how we steward our past and future.
- **KNOW**
	- At the core, the first part of our heritage is simply knowing.
	- Our Psalm today starts with a knowing - "When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion."
		- The people of Israel would have heard the stories of God's faithfulness - so grand and miraculous, it was as though the people at the time were dreaming.
		- There would have been more stories that would have been told that shaped the identity of the ancestors of the people of Zion - patriarchs and matriarchs, times that sound surreal, moments that are mundane.  No matter what the story, it would remind those who heard about who they are, and who God is.
		- Because, in the end, there very well be nothing new under the sun.  Those before us have gone through Times of plenty, times of want - and God has been there, too.
	- It's why we've continued the work to tell our own stories again - the work Jenny's continued - it tells us the story of our own identity as a people in this corner of Jacksonville.  The good, the bad, the hopeful, the disappointing.  And we remember that the story of our Presbyterian identity isn't just from this place - but its own family tree connects far further: Germany, France, Scotland.  Our current denominational heritage is shaped by divisions and reconciliations - a spaghetti plate's worth of different directions.
		- It can be tempting, especially in a time of progress, to treat the stories of who we've been as a relic or even irrelevant.  This can be the progressive's blind spot.  Yet to do so limits the celebration of God's presence - where we ultimately draw our identity - leaving us to think we are here alone.  And whether we like it or not, we do carry the marks of our past.  I am the product of centuries of living in Appalachia.  I might want to become a cosmopolitan citizen, but my story still is in the foothills of Westmoreland County and Kane, PA, the plains of Southern Indiana, and the cornfields around Greenford, Ohio.  I want to carry the stories of a blue-collar upbringing because no matter what, I am grounded in the stories of faithfulness in that time.  The Lord indeed has done great things for us in our past.
		- It can also be tempting to see the stories of the past as something enshrined, which can be the conservative's blind spot.  That the past is better than the present, better than the future.  Yet that has two problems - enshrinement too quickly creates an idol, far too easy to worship instead of a God who is beyond time and is still with us, and in its statuesque permanence, is more apt to become for us a museum piece - or worse, a mausoleum - stared at and grieved over while the Lord might very well being doing good things for us in our present, and should we continue to sow, carry sheaves of joy.
- **GROW**
	- So knowing can't be enough.  We have to grow.
		- Commentators argue that this Psalm's beginning verses reflect the past - God *did* do good things for us.
		- We have to take the places where our knowledge of the past and how it's shaped us can be changed and applied to today.
		- This is at the roots of our heritage as reformed Presbyterians: _Ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda_.  The church reformed, always reforming.
		- We believe this for two reasons.
			- We recognize our nature as fallen and sinful individuals.  We will make mistakes, and institutions we create will fail.  And so we continue to return to the core of what we're called to do as faithful people, and make changes.
			- We also recognize a God who is still active, and is not bound to the past nor to a contemporary cultural moment.  Instead, it compels us to discern as best we can to the seek the very essence of our identity.
	- We can see this in our Gospel text.
		- We meet Bartimaeus on the roadside - and his shouts rise above the crowds.
		- And perhaps the conventions of the day, the ways that the people had shaped their identity, would lead them to believe that a blind man shouting was not worth the time of Jesus.
			- Yet here, we witness Jesus not be bound by a cultural moment, nor the past, but instead honor what his calling was - literally to restore sight to the blind.  
			- And in that moment, he assists the community of believers, even in their own fallen moment, consider a change - what will it be like the next time someone hopes to be healed?  For their tears to become shouts of joy?
	- But even with that growth, it begs the question - can this growth, this body reformed and reforming, stay static?  The answer, surely, is no.  And so, as we know and grow, we must go.
- **GO**
	- Psalm 126 is one of the songs of Ascent - part of the songs of a group of people on pilgrimage.
	- Hear it again with Eugene Peterson's Message:
		- It seemed like a dream, too good to be true, when God returned Zion’s exiles. We laughed, we sang, we couldn’t believe our good fortune. We were the talk of the nations— “God was wonderful to them!” God was wonderful to us; we are one happy people. 
		- And now, God, do it again— bring rains to our drought-stricken lives So those who planted their crops in despair will shout hurrahs at the harvest, So those who went off with heavy hearts will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing.
	- The knowledge of God to the people, and the growth of the people to know that God's faithfulness will not just be limited to one time, erupts with the Psalmist shouting 'now God, do it again!'
	- But it's not without their own effort: they will journey.  They will sow their seeds, even if they are weeping, and will come home with shouts of joy.  Their blessings will be abundant.  
	- I find in my own life - a God who has been present with a family since 1792, with initials still inscribed, is a testament - and yes, there are certainly moments of weeping, moments of failure, moments that the families of my ancestry needed to grow - but I am here.  And as I continue to be one more branch on an ever growing tree, I will also be a story to generations to come.
	- SJPC carries the same.  And so we steward its ministries because the stories of God's faithfulness matter.  We take them and realize that we neither ignore who we've been, nor try treat this institution as something so static and brittle that the movement of time and the need to reform would cause it to crumble.  We don't change just for the mere sake of change, but we desire to live more like those who believe that God moves with us - is in our past weeping, and in our future joy, assisting us in our present sowing.  
- Thanks be to God for our story - for the matriarchs and patriarchs who humbly came before, who invite us to journey as well.
