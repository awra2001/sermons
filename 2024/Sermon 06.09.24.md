- For the next two weeks, around our time with Nat Glover, there was a request from the Civic Engagement Committee to explore Biblical issues related to how we might think about living faithfully together amid a fractured world. And as much as we can all laud this issue, it often sounds good on paper but then falls flat. To say to one another, "Be better at community," or "Go be nice to each other" is like saying, "Go exercise more" - I know it will help me, but ask me that when the temperatures are reaching double digits.
- That has been on my mind for the last few weeks, including when I was away in Pittsburgh for the Festival of Homiletics.  In the midst of feeling miserable with what, of course, I later found out to be COVID round two, I did happen to steel myself to sit in the grand space of East Liberty Presbyterian and listen to the Rev. Dr. Matt Skinner, a PCUSA pastor and professor at Luther Seminary.  And he preached - although for a slightly different reason - on this text today.
- To be completely honest with you, this is a text that I had forgotten about. It doesn't come up in the lectionary, and it's likely one that in my New Testament survey I sleepily rushed through to get to the end - such is often the fate of the next to last chapter of any book. Yet, it's interesting here to see how the writer of Acts takes his time to unwind this story.
	- We begin our story with the sea.  The sea was essential to the prosperity of the regional cultures and empires. It was a place of promise.  At best, it was a place to prove the stability, innovation, and power of the cultures over danger.  It is a chance to be the maker of a way through chaos and demonstrate control over what is resolutely uncontrollable.  And in this time, the Roman Empire has from one end of the sea to the other claimed it as its own.  It proves its authority, its capability.  And more often than not, it can.  The culture, the power, and the Empire have promised stability, even over what it cannot control.
	- In this story, we find ourselves with Paul, a prisoner on his way to appeal his case in Rome, and his guards are companions with him as they hitch rides on merchant vessels.  As Skinner reminded us in his sermon, while we see in this story Paul as the centerpiece, to the rest of those on the ship, he is a nobody, another face in the crowd.
	- And what we hear of their journey reads like a bad day at the airport: constant delays, rebooking connections, slowing down and down and down. 
	- The early hearers of this story would already know what is happening by verse 9: with the fast already gone, we find ourselves in the early fall.  By this point, the sea is unsafe.  The storms will come.  
		- And this is our first point of living faithfully together: the storms will come.  We feel them. We see storms across our seas: The Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights states that across the world there are currently 110 armed conflicts. And closer to home there are continued storms, including the one culminating in our fall time as well.  Perhaps you, too, may be going through a personal storm.  They are on the horizon for each of us.
	- Paul still finds his way on a ship from Alexandria - a grain vessel meant to feed those under Roman authority.  Should these boats not support the needs of the empire, there will be unrest.  And so, as is human nature, when authority is questioned, even by what is beyond its control, it forges ahead.  Economic, political, and military powers are all on board, forging ahead. 
		- This is the second point: a culture determined to seek and maintain power and authority will do so at the cost of anything else.  And it does not matter what side or camp you find yourself in - they are simply sides of the same coin, living into the hubris of controlling the uncontrollable for the sake of power.
		- And in fair times, pleasant weather, it goes by unnoticed.  But when faced with a storm, the illusions of control begin to show their vulnerabilities.  Begin to raise anxieties.
	- Paul tries to speak a prophetic word - maybe less prophetic than common sense - you know this isn't going to go well for us.  As much as, at times, we as people of faith may want to speak into the world, it might very well not listen.  But notice what Paul does not do - he doesn't try to evangelize; there is no "You're going to hell because you are awful, so pray a prayer and hope God's got listening ears on."  Paul speaks wisdom, even if it's rebuffed.
	- And, to no surprise, the storm comes - the only time this word is used in the whole Bible, it is described as if the winds themselves have taken on rage - a whirlwind of a Nor'Easter.  It is now survival mode - the jig is up, and all of the trappings of authority and power are thrown overboard.   
		- And what a phrase here: "When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest raged, all hopes of our being saved was at last abandoned."  We hesitate to feel that.  Call it blind optimism, pride, what have you - but when we illusion of control falls away, it leads to despair.  Look around you today in this country and how could the rage of our current storms not invite us to despair? And when it does, we should hold it - it means that our hearts still feel.
	- Paul speaks God's word: the comfort of the institution may fall away, but we will survive.  There are things to tend to after this storm.  This is not the end of God's work in the world.  But, Paul says, even though you may want to abandon ship - to leave the community - the only way to make it through is together.  All 276 of them.
		- Here is the third point: it is not the institution that survives, but it is the community.  A community that looks past the trappings of power and projected authority.  That does not ask for a litmus test.  That when, in fact, it all fades away, all that is left is the beloved community in total.
	- Finally, Paul breaks bread, gives thanks, and feeds the community.  And they ate their fill.  It spurns them on with the strength to swim ashore.
		- The fourth point: God's table of grace is always present in the midst of the storms for God's beloved community.
- The power of this text for the Saints - each of us - is a reminder that it isn't the institutions that save us amidst the storms.  It is God's faithfulness amidst the community.  It is the recognition that we cannot go backward, we cannot always avoid the storms.  When they come, we have one another.  And it is the story heard over and over - stay.  Be with.  Witness God's faithfulness to us.  Eat.  Bring your pain, your despair, your anxiety, the trust of failing institutions (including, perhaps, the ecclesial), and witness God's safety.
- Do you know why I have such confidence in this church?  It is because whether we realize it, we live this today.  We gather as different people, willing to jettison what needs to be left, and gather with each other as we navigate the storm.  It has been in being with each other that I've found hope, I've found joy.
- On Friday night, our Preacher during Montreat, Gail Henderson-Belsito told us about a greeting of the Masai people in Africa.  The traditional greeting that passed between Masai warriors: "And how are the children?" It is still the traditional greeting among the Masai, acknowledging the high value that the Masai always place on their children's well-being. Even warriors with no children of their own would always give the traditional answer, "All the children are well." Meaning, of course, that peace and safety prevail, that the priorities of protecting the young, the powerless, are in place. That Masai society has not forgotten its reason for being, its proper functions and its responsibilities. "All the children are well" means that life is good. It means that the daily struggles for existence do not preclude proper caring for their young.  And I can tell you, friends, that this week, a community gathered, the children were well.
- So do you see the storms?  Are you in them yourself?  Come be with the community.  Don't go alone.  Don't sequester yourself off in a smaller dinghy with a captain that has the hubris to believe they will sail through the storm unscathed.  Instead, stay - we are for each other.  We need one another.  Come eat your fill, and when it's time, together, we swim safely to shore.
