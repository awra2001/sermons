- JOHN
	- I love The Message translation for the text this week because in this case in particular, it feels so common place and familiar to us.
	- It begins with some of the newest disciples being called spreading the news to their friends.  They're convinced of who Jesus is and what he can do.
	- And, then, we meet Nathaniel.
		- Maybe you've experienced something like this too - you're terribly excited about something, and your friend replies "really?  That's what you're excited about?"
		- It seems Nate is wrestling a bit with the idea of this figure long promised would just happen to show up in Nazareth.
			- We're not sure why this is the case, to be honest.  We don't know too much about Nathaniel, nor do we have a good sense of any issues between his hometown in Cana and Nazareth.  
			- But, of course, we can draw all sorts of reasons, even from our own personal lives.  At times, we have our Nazareth, and at times, we're from Nazareth for someone else.  
			- And, perhaps, the story could have ended here.  But what is meaningful here is that in spite of his skepticism, Nathaniel still goes to meet Jesus - come and see.  Move towards that which makes you skeptical, and witness it with your own eyes.  This seems the only way to really navigate our way our of skepticism of others - move towards and witness.
		- Jesus, for his part, gives such an interesting response.
			- The word here about deceit (or, in our Message translation today "not a false bone in his body") - *dolos,* can almost be thought of like a bait for fish.  
			- Jesus recognizes that this isn't a trap.  He's not trying to mess with Jesus or discount him, but instead seems to be coming from a completely different place altogether.
			- Had Jesus been defensive; had thought that Nathaniel was speaking out of turn, it also would have ended the conversation, too.
			- But, instead, by acknowledging Nathaniel's honesty, it becomes disarming.
		- Nathaniel is taken aback, of course - how could this guy know me?  
			- And while yes, Jesus performs the supernatural - I almost wonder if because of his response (almost arguing that really, this is a really low bar for Nathaniel to be impressed by Jesus by), what Jesus is doing is demonstrating something so important - that being known is a desire in our hearts so deep that when it happens, we realize that there we meet the Messiah in our midst.
			- It's not that Jesus saw him under a fig tree, but it's that Nathaniel, at his heart, was good.  Was worth knowing.  Was worth discipleship, companionship.  Was worth offering even more than that asides.
- SO WHAT
	- Can't help but think on an MLK weekend, in a continued polarized society, that this text reaches right into the depths of our hearts.
	- As people of faith, meeting Christ through our disciple's walk, we begin to carry hope.  A hope of being known.  A hope of having our hearts loved even when our actions push that love away. 
		- At times, as we witness with Samuel, it may mean the prophet's word spoken of God's justice being done to push away the brokenness of the present moment.
		- What we may hear here, however, is as though Nathaniel simply chose not to head towards Jesus in spite of himself.  Better to live in one's own skepticism, one's own defensiveness and see dimly, hear nothing but the silence.
		- But even in the midst of that word, it is for a future of justice!   Of right relationship!  The world Dr. King spoke in truth - that the world must change, but what can come is so much better.
	- And Jesus is waiting for us, just down the road a little, already knowing us - our innermost parts, before we knew so.  Before we believed that perhaps we were undeserving of that love.  
	- The question is if we're willing to go towards and witness to, in spite of our unbelief.
	- And, when we do so, are we willing to help others do the same?  To point them to the same one who first loved us?
	- When we do that, we help people imagine far more - perhaps witness a glimpse of heaven itself.
- CLOSE
	- This week, I was talking to one of the members here about our 9:00am Sunday School.
		- If you haven't attended, it's a kind of "ripped from the headlines" study where we will look at something that happened and apply Scripture to it.
		- While often times, the topic is interesting, what's more enjoyable for everyone is the way everyone interacts with each other.
		- Almost everyone I've talked to about the study comments on how there's such a wide-range of people from all sorts of points of view, yet somehow, everyone is able to make the space a place where they're able to grow by learning from each other.  It feels safe to come from different points of view.
		- I wonder if folks comment about that so much because at least right now, that seems like a way of interacting that is less and less common.  And it's not the first time we've explored the topic or how it's affecting each of us... but there is a certain amount of pride I certainly feel when I hear folks celebrate that here, at SJPC, we are willing to hear one another in spite of our difference.  It's a hallmark value, it seems of our community - a value that defines us as unique.
		- I wonder if we see that as something so life changing; so significant.  So transformative.
