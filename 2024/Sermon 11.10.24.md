“You’re here so that you don’t ever come back.”

Those were the words my dad said to me as I sat in the break room, near tears, during a particularly long day during my sophomore summer internship at American Standard.

That year, instead of the cushy office intern job I had my first summer of school, I worked on the sink and tub line floor.  What began as an apprenticeship spraying enamel on sinks as they went by on the line - and I pray none of you have one of those in your homes - led to then becoming the “Six Sigma support” on the floor.

Which, I came to find, was another way of saying a glorified janitor.  And it became a particularly grueling effort.

I would begin the day around six, blast furnaces meeting the humid summer mornings in Ohio as I entered the gaping maw of truck bays in the rear of the plant.  Years of work had obscured what little windows lined the top of the century-plus-old building, so whatever sunrise I saw on my drive in was subsequently returned to the dark.  If you are starting to imagine the early gates of hell, you’re on the right track.

And to add to the Dantean feel of my time, my first job was to sweep the floors of the plant.  Sounds reasonable, until you again remember that this plant is over a century old and with its own movement of hot and cold spaces, created an atmosphere that no sooner had I completed the task, dust, and soot would fall again on the floor; a never-ending cycle of work.

Then it was painting pathways to ensure people would not get in the path of products.  There is no paint that reliably sticks to a floor that has a constant state of soot-fall.

These are the things I remember; thankfully time shuts away memories, except for one: in spite of my efforts, repeated forty hours a week, I had a manager who took what seemed an outsized delight in adding to my torment.  I was so thankful to have learned each nook and cranny of the floor because I could avoid her most of the time.  But the time I couldn’t, I would hear it.  Not good enough, not fast enough, do this do that why can’t it be cleaner.  No matter how hard I tried, there was a persistent reminder of my station in comparison to hers: I’m nothing but a lowly janitor, and I should get used to it.

I finally reached the breaking point six weeks in, feeling emptied from the inside out.  And so, I sat with my dad on a break - my dad, an elder statesman of the plant, having worked there for decades - and told him I wasn’t sure I could keep it up.

“You’re here so that you don’t ever come back.”

At first, for my late teen mind, that statement soothed my ego.  Sure - go do the worst job, make sure you study hard later.  Get away from the ever-oxidizing steel belt, and find a better thing to do.

But in the years that followed (yes, I did make it, and did come back - returning to other internships throughout college), I started to think differently about the statement.  The thesis changed as I had children of my own, and in equal measure appreciate the hope for something better, but grieve the idea that my dad might not have considered his work enough to be proud of.  It changed as I walked with my family as American Standard was bought out by a venture capitalist firm, gutting the plant to the point that my dad's ending salary when he retired was lower than mine during that janitorial internship, because grief and pride neither one will pay the bills as one is facing not being able to pay the bills, devoured by a company and a system he put into to care for our family... but still, he did it anyway.

Most of all, I started to see that no matter the season in my life, I’ve been back somehow sweeping floors, knowing the soot is gonna fall.

This is, in the end, the reality of good stewardship.  Hear it in the word itself: steward.  Its roots are in two Old English words that mean a house warden: to be a steward is to care and provision for the needs of the community you have charge.  By nature, then, it is the custodial, blue-collar efforts of service that ensure all is well.  It’s also the case, I imagine, that like the sinks and tubs that moved past me as I swept, the steward is unseen when as is well, but the second something is not right, the anxiety and urgency fall upon them.

It’s not a far stretch, then, to realize how the work of Christian stewardship is just as blue-collar and custodial.  We are set everyday about the work of sweeping the floors of a world where we are certain - until Christ returns - we’re going to have to sweep the soot again.  Nothing in this world is built to last forever, so it is the persistent effort of repair, maintenance, Rosie The Riveter roll-up-your-sleeves effort done well enough to be imperceivable.  And when it doesn’t happen, the world responds in urgent anxiety - why isn’t this better, not good enough, not fast enough.  And friends, I probably don’t need to say much more than that to demonstrate how much the world and our country need its stewards.

Of course, I mentioned that this breakpoint happened about six weeks in.  And I didn’t end up weeping my way throughout my summer.  Instead, and I’m entirely sure it was consciously, I stopped looking at the start and stop - stopped wincing at the hellgates as I walked through, stopped thinking about why the third shift guy couldn’t get his act together to leave me with the mess - instead, I focused on the middle, in the moment.  I realized that moving for eight hours a day exercising your body in 110 degree heat at 19 actually does wonders for your body - I mean, people pay money for hot yoga, and here I was with new muscle, losing my freshman 15 turned 25 turned 30.  And I started to take pride in paint that finally stuck to the ground because I kept working on it - and took even more pride in the way that people actually walked between the lines.

But more than anything, I got to see my dad in a new way.  We shared something those summers that no one else did.  I saw how respected his was, how hard he worked for my family in that plant, in a job that I’m not sure ever lived into the highfalutin talk of “vocation,” but did it well. Once I stopped acting as though somehow this job was an affront to me and just doing what I was meant to do, I saw the small miracles all around.  And it was the gift of being with those folks - my dad, that keep me grounded.  I found a new gift of community and love when I finally stopped worrying about the task and just was the steward.

This is what the rich young ruler couldn’t do. As Michael so adeptly noted in his sermon at the start of this stewardship season, his problem was not his resources but his ego, tied into his wealth—an example of Jessica’s reminder from last week about where our hearts might lift idols. It became a bridge too far to put aside the beginning and end for the sake of what could happen in the middle if he had given everything away to the poor. He missed the miracle.

And if the rich young ruler is the example of missing that middle, our two texts today are the response of when someone does.  Here, we have two widows, who for all intents and purposes are on the lowest end of their societies.  Not quite pariahs, but never much higher on the scale than the custodian, they have nothing else to do but to offer up themselves in the moment, even in the case of the woman in Zerepath, every last that she had.  If anyone had the right to be concerned about the ends, it was the woman with Elijah, who feared starvation should she go about the task.

Ah, but do you hear?  That’s where God is.  The widow always had enough.  The jar never went empty.  The work of stewardship in moment, offering the household what it needs meant that the world, at least for that moment, was restored.

It is that heart - a heart offering all - that Jesus commends at the temple.  Reflecting on my summer, I find myself far too in line with the scribes.  I wanted to have the respect of that marketplace and a place of honor - not to routinely manage the scraps.  But what stewardship ultimately does that become, truly?  Jesus’s caution - a greater condemnation as a result of devouring widow’s houses and keeping up appearances sounds much like spackling over cracks in the foundation: a pleasant appearance hiding inevitable collapse.  It works for a moment, but it will be destroyed without the heart of a steward who gives what they had.

And I believe that’s the question, as we end our stewardship season, that we have before our hearts.  Do we, dear siblings in Christ, have the custodial heart?  Michael argued that in a world that can very easily devour itself, that the church must be stronger than the next crisis.  

The custodial heart: that is how.  

All of the gifts given - no matter the amount - are meaningless without the heart that offers everything.  That believes beyond itself that the jar won’t run dry because in the midst of the custodial work, God will be present.  God will provide.  That it isn’t truly about being here so we don’t come back, but in being present to the now, we witness and work towards the what-can-be, what-should-be, and what-is, done in ways that might be imperceivable, but with the heart, truly last.

How easy would it be, y'all, to have treated the last few years of our history like the worst internship you've had?  To feel no beginning, no end, constant retread, the world pushing down saying not good enough, not fast enough, do better do better.  We would be forgiven if we hurried along, pushing faster and faster towards the next chapter.

Because if we don't, we're convinced our jar will run dry.  We will die the uncivilized death of starvation, having given too much.

But we didn't.  We stuck in.  We gave our hearts fully.  And the miracles happened.  The jar did not run dry.

When we wondered if we would see children fill the space, and now they fill our Sundays and Wednesdays with laughter and joy.  The jar did not run dry.

When we feared if we could have the provisions to build a new building and reorient our ministries, we found willing givers from the smallest to the largest - the jar did not run dry.

When pandemic pestilence, pastoral peculiarities, or partisan politics could have torn us apart and caused us to devour one another, we found new ways to come back together - to grow, to flourish... the jar did not run dry.

Had we thought we would not starve by pushing through, we would miss every last miracle of abundance that sustained us.

There are names of people who weave themselves silently into the miracle of this church and its story today.  Stewardship is the celebration of the quietest miracles in the unlikeliest places that, when done enough, create the institutions strong enough to weather each and every crisis that will come simply because there will always be someone there to repair the breach - brings celebration to others who carry on the task.  I want to be a faithful steward to honor my dad - and others, so that they no longer have to say “You’re here so you don’t come back,” but instead “because you’re here I’m glad to come back.”

Imagine churches full of janitors and widows.  Of custodial stewards who believe that in the work God will be present.  What I’ve come to realize is that we can’t just imagine, because the need is too great.  There are so many ways this church shows its unwavering belief in God’s abundance, and with a world anxious, we must continue to go.  It’s not glamorous and will push us to wonder if the work will ever end.  So as we give today, let us give our hearts.  And right after, let’s grab a broom.  Grab a brush.  Quicken your steps with anticipation of seeing God’s miracles.  Delight in a job well done, in the abundance that brought you there.  And let the world know that here, the jar has not run dry.  It never will.  And let us all give thanks to a God who delights in the heart of a steward.  Amen.
