- So, I must be honest with you all today: I don't feel all that good.
	- I don't know what it is sometimes about traveling.
	- I'll mark it up as two separate allergy seasons this time.  I just had gotten through Jacksonville allergies, my body steeled against it, and then I headed to Pittsburgh.
	- Not to mention, many people travel, and who knows what they all have.
	- So, suffice it to say, I'm trying to survive on cold medicine, making sure I use copious amounts of hand sanitizer and being careful of where I touch and when.
	- But, if I had my druthers this morning, I'd still be in bed.
	- When these moments occur for all of us, when our bodies betray our will, we have to rest on miracles.
- We sometimes gloss over the degree of miracle this day offers us as the people of God.
	- This wind.  It is violent.  It is powerful.  Emotive.
	- The same kind of violence tears the skies to place a spirit upon Christ as he hears he is beloved.
	- The same power tears the temple curtain in half from top to bottom.
	- It is the type of power that pulls boulders from tombs.  And here, on this day, we remember it comes to us.
	- And what lands on the disciples is also something powerful - a fire.
		- We don't need to detail what fire is and can be.
		- But here they find themselves resting gently, stable, upon the heads of the disciples.
	- And from there, they speak - they speak the gospel; they talk about hope for the future.  What is to continue - the new future.
- God trusts us with this kind of power.
	- It's helpful on a day like today when I feel one arm tied behind my back - how can God trust me, trust us?
	- That is the wrong question for today because it's already a given.
	- Instead, the better question is how can we live knowing we're trusted?
- In my travels this week, many preachers acknowledged the voices we often hear in our churches.
	- Some winds blow whispering of decline, of failure.
	- Some winds blow that say God is not at work.  What can God do in our world today?
- And yet here, God ignores all of that.  All of the ways we can presume we aren't good enough, capable enough, that we'd prefer to control our destiny.  God still offers us power.
	- What else would be expected from our caring Shepherd but to carefully give the tools of power, and only what would we be able to handle?  As if when offered the blazes of heaven God would allow us to be burnt?  
	- And so, friends, we need to claim this!  We need to believe it!  What we have upon our heads today is an anointing of power and Spirit.  It has the power to break through the barriers of language and misunderstanding in order to preach the truth.
	- That this power today is the same one that brings bones long left to bleach in the sun to life.  That upon what's long considered dead wraps the movement of life.  
	- And it's not ours to own, but ours to participate in - to witness to.  Look around you today.  This is what we can witness!
