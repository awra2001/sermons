[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Mark/Mark 16]]

- Of all the gospel stories of this day and this moment in time, Mark's is the most unique.
- Many begin the same way - a group of women are performing their responsibilities in a way that would have been culturally expected.
	- And there's something really lovely and very normal about the conversation they're having with each other - who will get this stone rolled away for us?  I imagine if this was for today, this is conversation parents would be having with each other: how are we going to get the kids up?  How will we get them dressed in their Easter best?  It's the type of thing that seems perfectly pedantic.
	- Which tells us that, at least to our friends here, everything was going as expected.
- Until, of course, it doesn't.
	- The stone was rolled away, and here's some guy - who we never truly know, saying "don't be alarmed!"
	- Which, typically, at least the way movies go, if someone random tells you not to be afraid, the first thing any character will do is, in fact, be very afraid.
	- That same man, in the chaos of the moment, also tells our friends that Jesus clearly isn't here, but has gone out ahead - he's done what he said.
- Verse 8 
	- This all seems to create a fight or flight moment for our friends, too: their wild moment has created a panic.
	- Even the way the Greek explains this gives you the sense that they had their breaths taken away - they run away with a mix of terror (lit. shaking) and amazement (in other uses, it's related to outbursts of frenzy).
	- And in their fear, they run away, silent.
- If you take a moment and look at your Bibles, then, you'll notice that from the earliest of manuscripts, this is where the story is supposed to end.  The women fearing, telling no one, and we never see Jesus.
- This is, like I said to the children, a pretty unsatisfying way to end a story.  So much so, that over time, other endings have been added.  You get to have two more of them for Mark - a quick one, and a bit more extended one.
- I've never watched the Sopranos, but I do know that the finale of the show, now many years past, still raises similar frustrations in its opened endedness - we see the family gathering at the diner, "Don't Stop Believing" blaring through our televisions, a camera shot heading towards their booth, and the scene cuts to black.
- David Chase, the creator and director of the Sopranos, has had to constantly give interviews about this ending, where so many want to know the answer.  In 2015, in response, he said this:
	- The ceiling I was going for was "don't stop believing". It is very simple and on the nose. That's what I wanted people to believe. There are attachments we make that are worth so much and we're lucky to have been able to experience them. Life is short. Either Tony dies here or some other time. But in spite of that, it's really worth it. So don't stop believing.
	- In other words, in an effort to get to some concrete conclusion, we might miss all the other things that happened up to that point.  They don't become less simply because of an ambiguous ending.  Maybe they become more.
- Whether we can to acknowledge it or not, we all come to this day with some expectations.  Maybe they're the normal, pedantic expectations of going to church for the sake of family.  Maybe we have this day set aside for our children to continue to have touchpoints of faith.
- For me, I know I hope that this day is more than perfect.  That the Spirit is here, and each of you here are so overwhelmed by this Sunday that your life is changed - that this day begins a series of full pews, everyone committed to the life of ministry of SJPC and a revival happens.
- And so, like the women, we all walk here, our steps expected.
- So, imagine when at the end, all we get is some dude telling us Jesus isn't here.
	- We're likely to miss the details, our disappointment, dread, frustration gripping us.
	- And, so, I don't think we need to justify the women's decision: because if Jesus isn't here today, either, well, yeah, we'll probably all pack it up and go home.
	- Or, maybe, we'll find justifications to soften our frustrations - we'll create new endings, create a different story.
- What that all misses though, is this curious way the original Greek ends here in the original ending: the word "*gar*", which is often translated as "for, because, or however."
- Early scholars struggled with this - literally no other book of the Bible ends with this word.  It's too open-ended.  This becomes the David Chase gospel, and we don't know what happens next.
- But, maybe, like Chase, the writer of Mark is offering us an invitation to not stop believing.  That there are other attachments before this, and more attachments to be made after this that are unwritten.  After all, we know that while Jesus isn't here at this exact moment, he is ahead of us - we just simply need to catch up.  Mark offers us more with less.  Mark beckons us to remember the miracles before, the promised Kingdom coming near.  Mark invites us along the path to find where Jesus is - demonstrating the truth of resurrection to all around him.  And what's certain is that Jesus is not dead.  What's sure is that the promises are fulfilled, even if we don't get the satisfaction of the closure.  Because if we knew the conclusion - if everything was buttoned up, Jesus is here, we could close the book on this beautiful story and resurrection and go on with other things.  
- So, in the end, here's my invitation to each of you: don't stop believin'.  Because when has anything we truly believe in hinge on a singular moment of proof?  
- Don't let the Easter story become a final chapter written and then allowed to sit on a dusty shelf or abandoned to the long list of binge watched shows.  Instead, let the lack of complete conclusion allow you the curiosity to find the old connections and make new ones.  Keep finding Jesus ahead on the path as is promised.  That is more scary.  But, truly, it's a bit more amazing.
