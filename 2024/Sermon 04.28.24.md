- Last week, I spoke a bit about the need for each of us to focus on the idea of belonging and how that might be a better approach to think about things like inclusiveness.
- This is for a couple reasons: one, I think (as the text alludes to) it's a better representation of what we're tasked to do - to have people's intrinsic worth as part of the beloved community supersede their extrinsic characteristics
- And so, if last week was a theory of Biblical Belonging, today marks the practice of it.  What does this community of belonging look like?
- ACTS
	- SCENE
		- The world that Philip is working in doesn't look a whole lot different than ours
			- And certainly, the world of "all sharing in common" has started to get a little more complex for this new group of disciple: Issues of dishonesty, of lack of care, and of attacks from a certain guy by the name of Saul have started to creep up
			- But instead of insulating themselves, the disciples choose to strike out to help others learn about Christ.  Philip, our friend here, has already began his work with the Samaritans, and now finds himself being directed to head towards the desert.
		- And it's interesting to note that the scene Luke lays out already should lead us to find the environment uncomfortable - the word here can describe both that Philip heads south, but also perhaps moving at noon.  And generally, as with Jacksonville in July, no one wants to travel during the heat if they can avoid it!  Yet, still, Philip goes.
		- I love how one of my commentaries put it this week: "So midday in the middle of the Gaza desert, Philip encounters a wealthy, chariot-riding, God-fearing, Bible-reading African official. Just another day in the life of a Christ evangelist—with another wrinkle that’s really the main feature."
	- EUNUCH
		- Who Philip races to then, is the Ethiopian Eunuch.
		- This person does not fit any convenient box that any one would want to put them in.
			- The eunuch would have enjoyed extended authority, wealth, and privilege.  
			- Yet, still, as a eunuch, he also was a deviant with normal society.
				- In fact, based on the Hebrew texts in Deuteronomy (23:1 in case you want to look it up), people like the eunuch were not invited to be a part of the assembly.
				- Moreover, this eunuch - partially man, though not all man, would have been viewed in Greco-Roman society as a (again, to quote a commentary of mine): "a permanently emasculated, mutilated figure unable to procreate - in short, a threatening sexual anomaly."
				- And so, even in modern times, this eunuch's external characteristics can represent so many analogues of people and groups that depending on what our own concerns and proclivities are.  Are we skeptical of wealthy people?  Do we struggle to see the value of individuals who we understand their cultural deviance keeps them out of bounds of Scripture?  
		- And yet that doesn't stop Philip, and what he gets to is the heart.
			- I can help but consider how this text in Isaiah might have both spoken about Christ, but also to the eunuch - "in his humiliation justice was denied him" for someone that does not fit the mainstream would have struck deeply - which is why we shouldn't be surprised the question the eunuch asks Philip: "is this about the prophet or someone else?"
			- We don't know what was said between Philip and the eunuch, but what we know is that it was life-altering: nothing prevented the eunuch from being part of this new flock, and the result was the eunuch's heart rejoicing in belonging - the intrinsic worth far exceeding the external characteristics that would have left him unsure along the desert path.
	- And here, friends, is a story set in a time that did not know partisanship based on culture wars, nor fear-mongering based on jargon.  No one ate the rich.  No one was woke or questioned if this was too much "DEI."
	- Instead, it was love.  It was Christ manifest in a wealthy eunuch's chariot and in the waters of a well along the side of the road.
- LUKE
	- Philip's story is a dispatch from further down the vine: of fruit being brought forth - of connection to the source.
	- Far from being an error, we find Jesus noting that this abiding and fruit bearing brings glory to God.  
	- As a community, as as people, this is what we want, and what we need: to be bearing fruit, to be the branches that grow out - after all, a stock alone does little without its vines extending fully.
	- And what may need pruned and cleaned from us are precisely the things that would stop us from attending to the eunuchs of the world today that are asking questions, desiring in their hearts for there to be no barrier between them and the baptismal waters such that they can rejoice in what's happened.
	- Friends, if you're worried about our culture, if you find yourselves tired of the culture wars, etc etc... than pray for God to prune those weeds from your branch!  Go where the Spirit leads you, even it what seems the least likely of locales.  Listen intently for the questions of the heart being asked.  Prevent no one from their rejoicing baptism.  
- On Easter, I remember saying that I want nothing more than a revival at SJPC.  I heard voices rise up in affirmation.  
	- If you want that, too, then here's a path: a church full branches of all varieties extending far out from the branch bearing fruit.  
	- We don't want a monoculture vine - anyone who has ever gardened will tell you that the plants most susceptible to plague and destruction are in too large of a group of their own type.  
	- Instead, it is the grafted branches in all their glory affixed to the same stock that give them strength, beauty, and allow for greater fruit.
	- It will mean difference, uniqueness, those the culture deems acceptable and those who seem a threat - let their hearts be the guide.
