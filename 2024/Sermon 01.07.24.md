#epiphany #light #journey 

- This week I had a chance to be in Starke with a group of youth at Camp Montgomery.
- There's something special about that place, largely because it's out in the middle of nowhere.
- On these particularly chilly and clear nights, we had a chance to take in the night sky as a group.
- These are the kind of nights you just take in - warmed by a campfire, gazing upwards - there is just a proliferation of sparks of light, too numerous to count.  
- Found myself going back on two or three occasions just to continue to take it in.  A handy guide on my phone helped me know constellations, and also planets that were brightly visible.
- I tried to do the same thing when I got home afterwards, and it wasn't quite the same.
	- First, as a urbanite, I have to contend with light pollution.  Funny as that sounds (all those lights keep us safe), it does lead to an inevitability - what was thousands of stars now became tens.  Yes, some were visible, but it didn't have the same awe inspiring moment.
	- And, especially this morning, the stars were obscured by clouds.
- I know, of course, that all of those stars are still there, and even more besides.  The only way I'll be able to really see them again is to go out someplace clear and unobstructed.
- Of course, Epiphany is all about a light - literal star-finding, but also a reminder that the Christ child represents God with us: a light here on earth.
	- The Magi's skill was in reading the stars: not kings, per se, but instead are seekers, out somewhere in the beyond.  In their clarity of sight, they know something special has happened.
	- They first head into the city to speak with Herod.
		- And it is fascinating to see what obscures both Herod and the religious and political leaders that Herod gathers around.
		- The stories tell us that Herod was despised by most of the people of Jerusalem, but for the ruling class, the idea that some new Messiah was to come was, quite literally, the type of thing that was deeply troubling.  The word used here at its root is also the word used to describe torture.
		- So, in other words, in order to maintain their comforts and status, the Christ - the Messiah, the one who is to save the people - should be feared, and eliminated.
		- These drives and desires become a light pollution on their souls.  Even the response by the scribes - referencing Scripture itself, begins to cloud over them.
	- The truth is, of course, no matter how much Herod and those who support him may blind themselves, the light is still there.  The star still shines.
	- The wise ones knew that as well, and continued to travel on - out still into the night.  What they found was overwhelming joy.  The type of joy that one wants to offer praise for.  A type of joy that Herod will never find, sadly.
- At the start of a new year, I think we all can be circumspect.  We splay out our past like pictures thrown on a table, and begin to think again about what we'd want to carry with us, what we'd rather leave behind.  That is so much the impetus of resolutions.  We are trying to find the bright lights that will guide us on another year's journey, and hopefully help us locate that overwhelming joy.
- Yet, perhaps, the Epiphantic moment can remind us of a deeply important promise and caution - this Messiah - this God with us - is coming to lead, to shepherd.  There is an overwhelming joy there.
- But, what is required of each of us is to ask what is obscuring our sight.  We might be fearful of what we'd lose if we were truly led by this Messiah - power, authority, the comforts of controlling what lights we see... our place upon the thrones of our own lives, the central actor in a story we create for ourselves.
- We certainly are able to do as Herod and his friends did and say no to the Christ-light... to be terrified by what could be lost.
- But just as a clear night sky out in Starke cannot compare to the mottled Jacksonville sky - we deny ourselves the chance to be overwhelmed with joy.  
- And I wonder if there is a lot more to that trade that we might give it credit for in our faith journeys, and what is worth reflecting on as we leave this story.  In the end, who do we want to be?  The magi, or Herod?  The texts in the Sunday's between now and Lent help expand this idea for us, so perhaps for now, it's worth just letting that question rest in our hearts.
