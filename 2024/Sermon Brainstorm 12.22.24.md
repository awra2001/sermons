Theme: Hallmark movies & the Christmas stories
Stories that live up to the promise and contain the happy ending

Outline:
1. I love all the Christmas hoopla- Jessica
I love Christmas. I love everything about it, the warm cozy magic of it. There’s the lights and the decorations – I live in Avondale, and the luminaria is just the most magical night in our neighborhood. I love the wintery images of softly falling snow, even if here in Florida I don’t ever get to actually walk in that snow. I love curling up by the fireplace with a mug of tea and a book. I love every Christmas song ever written – except the Paul McCartney one (sorry friends). As far as I’m concerned, I cannot hear Mariah Carey sing  “All I Want for Christmas is You” enough times in December. I absolutely watched her Christmas special a couple of years ago. And I love a good Christmas movie, from the classics to the cringey. My mom and I have ordered matching White Christmas themed sweatshirts this year. I have watched all the Christmas Princess movies on Netflix. Give me a hallmark Christmas movie with it small town feels and cozy Christmas baking and city woman falls for failing innkeeper vibes, and I am here for every bit of it.

(And if you aren't aware of what a Hallmark movie is, let's let TikTok show us.)

2. I'm skeptical of the Christmas hoopla - Adam
Funny enough, for all the ways that, Jessica, you and I are pretty similar, this is one of the biggest ways we're clearly different.  I have this meme that stays in my photos as a stark reminder that the "All I Want For Christmas Is You" terror comes upon us every year.  And while I can agree that Paul McCartney was like a kid who got a brand new synthesizer for Christmas and just wanted to figure out how all the buttons worked on his song, I just can't get into most of the sappy Christmas stuff - give me Peanuts Christmas!  And sure, it's got it's sweet moments - Linus telling the Christmas story, everyone rallying around Charlie Brown.  But let's not forget how we get there.  Charlie Brown is a blockhead getting the worst possible Christmas tree.  Constant infighting to get the production at the school ready.  There, in all of that, at least it's real.  And you do you know what they're particularly upset about - you remember?  Commercialism is Christmas!  In the end, what I can't get behind with all of the over the top, schmaltzy Hallmark movies is that they're too sappy, to unrealistic, too perfect... which, at least for me, leads it to be all too inauthentic.

4. Tying hallmark movies to Christmas story - a story that delivers on the promise - Split
	1. In the end, don't we want the resolve? *Jessica*
		1. Hallmark movies just give it you easy
		2. Peanuts - everything is good: Linus tells the story, the little Christmas tree becomes beautiful
		4. Our heart crave, and themselves anticipate (maybe not realizing) that we crave a story with a joyful resolve.
	2. The anticipation of the ending colors the rest of the story *Adam*
		I think that's true.  This whole Advent season we've been talking about anticipation, and the idea of allowing the future to find itself into the crannies of the present.  And there's plenty of that that the future we're looking to put into the present is hard to understand or shape, themselves somewhat abstract.  So a Hallmark movie does make it a little easier - even just the phrase elicits a guarantee: no matter what, the magic is going to happen.  And, so, if we know that everything - schmaltz and all - will resolve itself into all that we are hoping for, find peace in, the love that will become, well, it brings us joy.
		
		And because of that, we're willing to ride through the grandmother in hospice, the first Christmas without dad, the deployed spouse, the Christmas tree that suddenly loses all its needles.  But we really do know, because we've been at the end, we know it's all going to be okay - more than okay - but amazing!!!!  That's especially true if you've seen the story over and over again, as so many aficionados do.


	1. And at the root of it, that's the story of Advent. *Adam*
			At the core, I wonder if our Advent story is the same... and that's taking a lot for me to have to say, because trust me, the eye-rolling feeling I have for these movies is not just an act for this sermon.  But, as the week has gone by, I've tried to make a little bit more peace with it, and start to see how yeah, there really might just be some good to it, and some real parallels to where we at in this season.  In Advent, we're just beginning to tell the story: the wide panned camera on the crane slowly descends upon the town square, and we're starting to catch glimpses 
		
		1. Advent is at the beginning of our story. 
		2. We're witnessing a change in the narrative.
		3. But it's the difference of not being in a movie, observing - we're going to have to live it.
5. Micah - hearing the promise of great things from small *Jessica*
	The people of Israel certainly lived the Advent part of the story. They had nothing but the promises, the glimmer of something different, the sense that perhaps something might shift. Our Micah text today reminds us that the Advent promises are not made in a vacuum, or in a cheery land where all is already well. These promises are made in the real world, a world where people are displaced, where violence, famine, and disease rip communities apart, where the future looks bleak. Micah reminds us that the Christmas story is exactly for everyone who has not heard good news this week, for whom the hope of good news is just a bridge too far to believe in.

The promises we heard this morning in Micah were given to a people in exile, a people who had been ripped from their homes after a protracted siege and occupied by foreign powers. These are promises for a people longing for a glimmer of something better in a world full of sorrows, for the tiniest sign that God might still be at work, might still care, might still be up to something in the world.

What they hear is that the thing they are longing for will come from the least expected of places. Yes God will restore the people of Israel, and yes it will be through the kingly line of Judah, but it will arise from the least significant part of the tribe of Judah. I love this tender little phrase, “You, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah.” ~~I can almost picture God holding out a hand to this little tribe, the way you might for a toddler, “Come here, my little one,” voice full of love and affection~~. And this, this little one, is where the hoped for ruler will come from, the one who will restore the people, who will return them home, who will shepherd God’s flock to the glory of God.

Think about how wonderful and preposterous this promise is. The people of God are looking for a show of might and strength, they are looking to the big players, the strongmen, the courtly diplomats, the great scholars and thinkers, anyone of prominence – surely that is who God will work through. And the Lord redirects their gaze to the small things of Israel, a reminder that God has always worked in the unexpected places. From a barren couple in their 90s birthing the people of Israel, to a destitute foreign widow becoming the mother of the line of kings, from a baby sent down a river in a basket of reeds leading the people out of slavery to a little shepherd boy slaying a giant to, God has always been at work in Israel raising up the lowly, showing up where God has no business being, transforming the world from the edges. This is the Advent promise, the promise that hope, peace, love, and joy, will show up in the places we least expect it.

3. Magnificat - anticipated fulfillment of the promise - Adam
	1. If this is story we'd expect, it shouldn't be in a lowly manger, but up on the top of the palace stairs
	2. It shouldn't the story of two immigrant women with the agency to, with God, bring forth the same small promise nestled with the hopes of the people in Micah.
	3. But yet, here it is.  Mary's "who am I?" seems even her recognition of the absuridity of it all.
	4. That's how God works.  Always in the small, always for the seeking, always with resolve?
4. How we live into Christmas - avoiding oversentimentalizing - Jessica
	1. What we want
	2. Observers
	3. Complexity
	4. I wonder if we can allow ourselves...between today and Tuesday, together to ....
5. How we live into Christmas - avoiding cynicism - Adam
	1. This is what hearts crave, what we want, why we watch the movies, why we pine for the snowglobed visions of all being frosty and bright.
	2. But yet, we're observers of it.  We watch, we hope, we dream, and then we turn our faces to the next family get-together wondering if we're come out unscathed from the next conversation
	3. And the issue is that we very well prefer to be observers than participants because we don't truly believe that this story is for us.  Always has been for us, and that we ourselves can be active participants, singing the same lofty glories to God as Mary does in the Magnificant, still saying "who am I," and God responds "who else, but you?"
	4. It is that cynicism that scares me from the Hallmark movies, scares me from the manger, scares me from taking comfort in "who am I?"
	5. I wonder then, if we might allow ourselves, between today and Tuesday, together, to find the small cranny of Bethlehem where God is promising resolution - almost too good to be believed.  And for a moment, witness, participate, and celebrate.  Be kissed by the long lost love from high school.  Find the Christ child, ready to be born, and sit in joyful wonder, for what God is still doing in the most expected of places.


- Trajectory of Advent is to believe in the promises, even if they're hard to believe.

	1. This is what hearts crave, what we want, why we watch the movies, why we pine for the snowglobed visions of all being frosty and bright.
	2. **But this is also why we avoid them, because they don't feel honest. They are too sanitary, too sentimental, they wrap up too neatly and they don't match the world as we know it, where happy endings are far from guaranteed.
	3. The problem comes when we choose to sit on the sidelines, let the movie unfold rather than wade into the action.  We watch, we hope, we dream, and then we turn our faces to the next family get-together wondering if we're come out unscathed from the next conversation... **or we just live into the sentimentality, let the twinkling lights and soft music wash over us, too afraid to expose our hearts to the world and face reality as it is, too afraid to get our hands dirty for the promise of Incarnation.**
	4. And the issue is that we very well prefer to be observers than participants because we don't truly believe that this story is for us.  Always has been for us, and that we ourselves can be active participants, wading through manger manure, smelling all of the muskiness of the awful moment, singing the same lofty glories to God as Mary does in the Magnificant, still saying "who am I," and God responds "who else, but you?"
	5. **What would happen if, between today and Tuesday, we allowed ourselves to stare clear-eyed into the world, with all of its heartbreak and disappointment, with all of the fear and uncertainty, to see the squalor of the nativity scene that matches the squalor of our world** and in the midst of it, to find the small cranny of Bethlehem where God is promising resolution - almost too good to be believed.  And for a moment, witness, participate, and celebrate.  Be kissed by the long lost love from high school.  Find the Christ child, ready to be born, and sit in joyful wonder, for what God is still doing in the most expected of places.
