This text bothers me.

Every year that it comes around in the lectionary, I find myself so frustrated by the scene set here.

What we have here, as our Bible's title it, is Jesus healing a little girl and a deaf man.  Which all sounds wonderful - the type of Jesus that warms our hearts.  If that's all we had to explore today, we could walk away feeling like this is the happy, healing Jesus.

But as we dig in more, we see it's not just that.  

Our story begins here with an unnamed woman, only identified by the fact that she's a Gentile of Syrophoenician origin, which really when coupled with the fact they're in Tyre, far afield from Galilee, is just repetition to make it clear she is not part of the tribe.  But we learn through the Hebrew Scriptures that the Israelites, Syrians, and Phoenicians have a painful history with one another.  

And all that this Gentile woman is looking for is the healing of her daughter.

I want Jesus to do what I know Jesus will do.  He will see her heart and call her blessed, and her daughter will be healed.

I want him to do what he does with the deaf and mute man: take him away from the glaring crowds who have already passed their judgment, offer himself, and with a word, heal him.

I want Jesus defined by the Isaiah passage and the James passage.  No partiality, no dishonoring the poor.  Jesus needs to "so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty."

And he doesn't.  Instead, this unknown woman, hoping to save her daughter, is met with a response that, according to the perfect savior of the world, she's a dog.

And as much as we may want to lessen the impact of this statement by saying, "Well, in the Greek, it's a diminutive - like a little dog," the point is still made: for the folks within earshot of Jesus's conversation, his companions, they'd know... "To identify oneself as a dog is therefore to draw attention to one’s miserable condition as an inconsequential creature (“a dead dog” 1 Sam 24:14; 2 Sam 9:8 NRSV) or to the miserable treatment that one is receiving (1 Sam 17:43; 2 Sam 3:8; 2 Kings 8:13). To refer to another human as a dog is to insult the other as among the lowest in the social scale (2 Sam 16:9)."

Jesus, here, is precisely the opposite of who Jesus should be - and lest we think this is just a Mark thing, Matthew tells the same story with the same language.

And the truth is if this is the type of God we're dealing with - one that will means-test someone's healing based on their heritage to make a show of someone's crisis moment, well, I'd be happy to quit right now. I would gladly turn in the collar, the faith, and the community and do something else with my life.

And I'm not the only one.  When we most recently took a look at the American Beliefs Survey of the area where almost every single one of our members lives, do you want to know why people who aren't currently involved in a church community choose not to participate in the church?  You guessed it: religious people are too judgmental.  And lest we think it's only those folks - that same issue ranks seventh on a list of reasons why someone who *is* involved in a church community no longer participates.  

But in the end, Jesus is wiser than what is let on here.  We need to come to a conclusion that doesn't take so many academic detours as to lose Jesus along the way.  And so I wonder, in the end, who was Jesus speaking to?  Because, despite the language, he still heals the daughter and showcases the woman's interpretation.  And then, in heading to heal the deaf man, Jesus heads further away from home.  We're reminded a couple of chapters earlier that Jesus's ability to heal was somehow diminished in his hometown, but things are different in the land of the dogs.  The dogs are given prime foods to be restored.

So Jesus isn't speaking for the woman's benefit.  He's talking to everyone else.  He's talking to me, he's talking to you.

Which bothers me as much, then.  As we prepare for Jessica's ordination, I listened again to Joyce Liberman's fantastic sermon at my installation. She charged all of us to ensure we did the hard Biblical work that might sometimes upset us.  And here's one of those times.  And I don't like that anymore if I'm honest with you.  I want warm, happy, fix-it-all-up Jesus.  Because maybe, if we're all happy, consciouses unpricked by the text, we aren't anxious.  We don't worry if a sermon or a word might turn someone off.  We capitulate to the economics of church life and place the prophet aside.  But if any of us honor our baptisms, our vows, we can't do anything but listen.

And when we attune our ears further, we witness that Jesus does not deny the daughter and the man anything but instead calls all those who find themselves the children at the table to consider how it honestly sounds for someone desperate for restoration to be told they're lucky if they get much at all.  That the woman had to prove herself, slur and all, is reprehensible, but how often might we insist on the same discourse on others?

We might not call folks dogs, of course, but do you know the frustration of these texts only to be accused of saying caring for others outside of our preferred tribe is somehow woke? That the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Spirit's guidance in human history culminating into this canon, is just a partisan plaything? Friends, I know I've said it before - if we use those lenses, we do no better than those Jesus is calling out here. Do we want 'anti-woke' to be the scraps of salvation to dogs? And lest you might believe because you might not be included in the story here because you might bristle against 'woke' parlance, I wonder who you thought of when I said the word and how you might describe them in your heart of hearts.  And friends, that's not much different than James's lament about partiality, and what he offers us in return is that those who we are not partial towards are those who the Kingdom will come to.

And that's the dilemma - if we ignore the words of Jesus calling out how we minimize the other, if we aren't willing to let what our Savior shows seep into our bones and redefine us, do we only see a limited God, unable to do in a hometown what is done in lands far away - a beloved community 40 miles off in the horizon as Tyre was?  And if we do, do we miss the healing?  Do we need to witness what we want to be warmed by?  Do our ears need to be unplugged from a Jesus who pulls us aside in private, speaks a word, and releases us healed to supply the needs of all?

Friends, the good Bible work is hard.  The good Bible work questions motivations other than God's.  And the wrestling we do in faithful community allows us to see the expansion of God's Commonwealth far beyond our imaginations.  It means everyone has their fill.
