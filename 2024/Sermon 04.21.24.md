- One of the words that often gets used for churches like SJPC is "inclusive."  Culturally, it designates that we as a church have made a commitment to not bar membership into our community based on what someone looks like or who someone loves.  We do this because of Biblical and theological convictions.  We look at the gospel, we consider that God's reach is for all people, and so we do the same.  
- Inclusion, of course, is connected to the word "include," the idea being part of the whole.
	- Any of us who are older siblings know all to well about including.
	- There is a rite of passage with every first born that requires inclusion of our younger siblings in activities of ours.  Often under duress, our parents will mandate us.
	- I imagine this is because our younger siblings look at what we're doing and want to feel like they're part of a different crowd - one they might see as cool. 
	- And, so, we do it, else we don't get to enjoy whatever activity that is what we wanted to do.
	- And I don't think it's limited to siblings.  Imagine any time any of you had to walk into an already set up group of friends.  Maybe it's the cool kids.  
	- In situations like these, I figure there are a few ways it can go.
		- You can feel alienated.
			- I'll never forget my senior year of high school there was an open invitation to a graduation party of one of the cool groups (of which I was decidedly not a part).  And it was an awkward feeling.  I remember overhearing, still in my memory over twenty years later, of people wondering why I was there in the first place.
		- You can feel like a prize.
			- This happens in churches often, especially those like ours that talk about being inclusive.  When, say, someone of who is different comes and finds a home here, we can almost treat them solely as that thing.  Sure, you're included, but you're still set apart.  You're "the young family," or "the queer person."  All of that still leads to alienation.
		- But there can be a third way - that a person can belong.
			- Belonging becomes something different.  It looks more at not just what is externally offered to the group, and sees someone with intrinsic worth.  It's Cheers in real life.  Everyone knows your name and they're always glad you came.
			- However, somewhere along the path of inclusion to belonging, some decisions have to be made.  It's rare, at least in my experience, that it happens organically on its own.  The power of holding onto belonging is too powerful.
				- Almost always, someone needs to vouch for the intrinsic worth.  It's the older sibling saying "no, they're cool."
				- It's, for instance, inviting anyone who comes through these doors the ability to be in membership, in leadership.  What matters isn't their external attributes, but their hearts.
				- The truth is, though, because the belonging is so powerful, to expand the circle wider comes at cost.  You might not be as cool as you once were once you vouch for your nerdy friend.  People might leave your church the moment the belonging line is transgressed.
- Texts
	- Our texts today invite us to remember though, that even with the cost, belonging is the task of the faithful.
		- Our passage in John today begins in the previous chapter with a healing of a blind man.
			- And it's an interesting question to ask - what extrinsic value would a blind man have in Christ's time?
			- Yet, that's not the issue here.  Jesus is not concerned about his condition, but instead his heart - his faith from hearing the gospel.
			- This comes at cost.  The Pharisees investigate the healing, and this interaction is worth its weight in gold:
				- [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#24|John 9,24-34]] So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and they said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man (meaning Jesus) is a sinner."  He answered, "I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."  They said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"  He answered them, "I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"  Then they reviled him, saying, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.  We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."  The man answered, "Here is an astonishing thing! You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.  We know that God does not listen to sinners, but he does listen to one who worships him and obeys his will.  Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.  If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."  They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you trying to teach us?" And they drove him out.[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#25]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#26]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#27]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#28]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#29]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#30]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#31]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#32]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#33]][[_Resources/Bible/MSG/John/John 9#34]]
			- If we don't get ourselves too buried in being "disciples of Moses," what we can see is the cool kids saying Jesus and the blind man aren't welcome.  They aren't included.  Jesus vouched and they're all rejected.
			- What Jesus then offers us is the gift of his shepherding.  A group where there's one flock, one shepherd.  A flock where shepherd - the one who carries the ultimate vouching - will pay all the cost for belonging.  And says as much!  Hear it again: I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold.  I must bring them also.
	- We also hear warning and hope in I John about this task.
		- Right before our passage today, we see the writer of John declare rather boldly that "whoever does not love abides in death."  
		- And what is love?  Being the shepherd.  Not just talking about, not just dragging folks along because we're made to, or to tokenize because it'll sound good on a website or in a sermon.  But in the being.  We offer no condemnation - no one is uninvited.
		- And if we don't do this?  Well, then we live in death.  
			- Have we taken Christ up on his offer, I think we get this.
			- In seminary, I had many colleagues who had been rejected by the church.  Some were GLBTQ, some were women that grew up in churches that still did not believe they should be in the pulpit.  I also served a small church in the middle of nowhere between Austin and College Station where the organist loved to joke about how his shotgun could fit in the organ bench in case of a terrorist attack.
				- To put it lightly, it was a bit of culture shock during the week.
				- And moreover, it was an act of continuous tension.
				- And it would have been easy at any given moment to have rejected either side:
					- As a cornfed white boy from Ohio, it was easy for my seminary colleagues to see all the people who had hurt them.
					- Conversely, I was nearly asked not to return to the little church I served in Texas because after one especially bad week of mass shootings I argued that sensible gun legislation might represent the Kingdom of God more faithfully.
			- But, as time goes by, I realize how doing that would have been acquiescing into living into death.  Instead, what I had to learn was to carry their stories.  Of what made them beloved as part of Christ's flock.  Of what parts of my own ego I was willing to let go of.
			- What it's meant was to carry their stories in my heart - correspondence of fellow sheep in Christ's flock - fellow sheep with you.  
			- And over time, what it's meant is more abundance: of ways to see God's work made real in other's lives who don't look like me or think like me.  It's meant they belong as I belong.  As you belong.
			- Did it cost something?  Sure.  It hurt.  Lots of hard conversations to be had when I had other things to do.  But there, even in a small way, was love enacted.
- This is the opportunity that lies before us in this beloved community.
	- It will be easy to talk big games, harder still to enact in action especially in the midst of pain, in the midst of the debate of whether certain folks extrinsic value speaks of the intrinsic worth.
	- And the sticky part will always be the all: shotgun toting organists and transgender pastors all.  It's not the extrinsic things that we presume as blindness but the inward heart listening to the words of faith offered to us.  That show us the Spirit's touch in others.  That show abundance.  From there, yes, we learn together.  We grow, debate, question.  But we never doubt the intrinsic worth as a fellow member of the flock.
	- But the question remains: do we want to live into death?  Or do we want to live into what we've been commanded: to love one another?  We may not be the cool kids.  But we will be Christ's beloved - who aren't just included, but belong.
