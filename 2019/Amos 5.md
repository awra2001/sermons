# Amos 5

THE POINT: Our energy should be in justice and righteousness.  Everything else is secondary.

* Leading from the children’s sermon
	* Did it bother you too when the piece was destroyed?  All that work.  
	* It breaks our heart when something of value is destroyed.
* But, this seems similar to what we find in Amos today.
	* The people of Israel at the time were exceedingly wealthy.  They built condos up on the hills.  They had lavash parties bathing in wine.  
	* They did it at the expense of the poor around them, and Amos was going to let them know about it.
		* God’s anger at the people of Israel, which is the harshest and most critical, was exclusively about the treatment of others economically and the mistreatment of justice as a result.  
			* Debt slavery
			* Other translations in Amos 5 mention a heavy grain tax against farmers.
		* These were God’s people, and they were being manipulated and oppressed by the same.  At some point, God would not let God’s people be oppressed any longer, even if it meant the judgment of others.
		* It is this lack of care, the manipulation of the market that is leading to Israel’s destruction.
* So what would have have been better?
	* It’s not worship!
		* Or at least it’s not worship without the right intent.
		* We often worry about God not hearing our prayers because 
	* It’s Righteousness and Justice
		* Righteousness
			* צְדָקָה
			* Honesty, accuracy, commitment to what is the level thing to do.
			* Right relationships, equity despite social difference
		* Justice
			* מִשְׁפָּט 
			* The steps one takes to ensure that correct injustice
			* The binds that hold together righteousness
	* You’d think it would have lead to some change?
		* Nope.
	    10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the very center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. 11 For thus Amos has said,
	‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
	and Israel must go into exile
	away from his land.’ ”
	12 And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there; 13 but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”
	14 Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am no prophet, nor a prophet’s son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, 15 and the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’

	* The whole system continued to support the wealth and power of a few over the needs of the many.  Amos goes home.
	* Amaziah, who you’d like to think would be on Amos’ side about God, instead is with the king.
	* Israel’s worship is compromised.
	
* What to do now?
	* Oh goodness.  Easy to make some parallels to today.  The way that we treat one another.  How we primarily see ourselves economically.  How we have a system that values some getting over on others.
	* We hardly are able to afford our own homes, and it’s predicated on what we earn.
	* Should you argue otherwise, you’re often decried as unAmerican at best.  
	* But what is modern debt slavery today?  What are the ways people are manipulated by grain taxes for the benefit of the most wealthy on the hills?
	* If we aren’t thinking of that, are we any better than the guy who kicks legos around?  Of God’s good people
	* And will God even pay attention to our worship?  Should we?  Should we believe in songs and prayers and sermons and anything that happens on Sunday if we aren’t examining what we’re doing about the least?
	* That is the core of some of the hypocrisy that we endure in the church, and interestingly enough, it has little to do with what seem to be the top 5 big issues that people think the church should be worried about.
		* You can’t tell someone they’re doing something wrong if you haven’t fed them first.
