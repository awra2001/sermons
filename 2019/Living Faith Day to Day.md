# Living Faith Day to Day

* Purpose Driven Life
	* 40 chapters, six sections, meant to “explain how the quest for personal fulfillment, satisfaction, and meaning can only. Be found in understanding and doing what God placed you on Earth to do.” (Later versions added 2 more chapters to explain how we don’t live that way).
	* Was on the NYT bestseller list for over 90 weeks.
	* By this year, 32 millions copies have been sold in 85 languages.
	* We’re driven to find purpose.  And I think that drive and that thirst become ever greater in more complicated times because there are more forces that have you doubt why or what you’re doing.
* I’m not sure we need 40 chapters to learn purpose or live faith day to day;  I think the majority of it is in one verse: Romans 12:1
	* Paul has spent the previous 11 chapters laying out his big theological treatise to the Roman people.  And then, after all that, he says “so…”
	* This should lead us to a first point: _that all of the work of theology is important, but it’s not the only thing.  Faith is not just knowledge._
	*  After that, he offers up a suggestion:  present your bodies as a living sacrifice
		* Present: παρίστημι: be present, render, bring before, stand.
			* _Living faith is intentional._  We have to render ourselves.  This is not just any action, but it starts with intentional movement towards presenting oneself to God.  Complacency is not part of faithful living.
		* Your Body: Soma: The whole body
			* _Living faith is all-consuming._  This is why the message is helpful.  It’s the sleeping, eating, going-to-work, walking around life.  The mundane.  It doesn’t need to be extravagant.  It just simply needs to be us, and us is enough.
		* Living: Zao: Be alive, offer life.  To not be dead.  To live transcendently.
			* _Living faith is active._  It’s not a spectator sport.  It’s not sidelined out somewhere.  In fact, that sounds much closer to death than life.
		* Sacrifice: Thusia: Gift, offering, Sacred Meal
			* _Living faith is giving._  Do we often imagine faith as a gift we are giving away?  That the mundane basic life we have is given to God and each other as a gift?  
	* This is the bigger frame for everything we do.  Our life in day-to-day faith is an intentional, active decision to give all of ourselves to God as a gift. 
* All of the rest of the reading today, then, can be read as how that big framework plays out in life.
	* Some of these are obvious aspirations: love from the center, be good friends.  Be inventive in hospitality.
	* Some of these are culture reversals that would change the world: Feeding our enemies, “get the best of evil by doing good."
	* Some of these, however, amplify how the intentionality of faithful living changes things.
		* Not burning out.  Perhaps the most faithful act we can do at times is simply to rest.  But let it be intentional.  Give rest away.  That part of the passage can read “don’t be reluctant to be eager, but let your soul boil over"
		* “Laugh with your happy friends when they’re happy, share tears when they’re down” sounds a bit like “thoughts and prayers” but we know intuitively the difference between the two, and it’s often about intentionality over anything else.
* Our fall challenge
	* As we head in the fall, I want this to be our challenge as a church.  
	* I’m going to start teaching a class about this exact topic.
	* But between here and Advent, what if focused on our intentionality?  Giving ourselves actively?  Recognizing we are enough.  That we give our lives in the ordinary, mundane ways.  What could this church look like?  What could our world look like?
