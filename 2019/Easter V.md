# Easter V

11:1 Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God.
11:2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,
11:3 saying, "Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?"
11:4 Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying,
11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me.
11:6 As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air.
11:7 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'
11:8 But I replied, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
11:9 But a second time the voice answered from heaven, 'What God has made clean, you must not call profane.'
11:10 This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven.
11:11 At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were.
11:12 The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
11:13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter;
11:14 he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.'
11:15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning.
11:16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
11:17 If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?"
11:18 When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, "Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”

* Water Chestnuts.
	* Couldn’t stand them.  Even though they didn’t have flavor, I just so often saw them as an impediment to my Sunday afternoon lunch after church.
	* I’ve never quite been able to kick a dislike of water chestnuts.  There doesn’t seem to be much of a reason why.
	* Maybe there are some for you, too.  Something no matter how often it’s presented in front of you, just can’t seem to shake it?
	* After awhile, it is a part of who I am.  I’m just someone who doesn’t like water chestnuts.
	* There can be all sorts of reasons to not like food - taste, texture, temperature.
	* There are certain foods, too, that we used to think were poison but aren’t now, like tomatoes.  I love tomatoes!  Or like garlic.  I love garlic!
* Peter’s particular pickle of a person problem.
	* The scene before us revolves around how we can think about unhealthy food.
	* For the Hebrews (and for some practicing Jews now, too), there are some foods that were off limits, because it's helped them have an identity.  
	* But Peter had began to have his identity change.  He wasn’t quite the person he used to be, and some of his thinking had changed because of Jesus.
	* In Peter’s vision, it’s another way that he’s beginning to understand a new identity, even in his food.
	* What he thought might have been unhealthy or unsafe, God was inviting Peter to eat.
	* And in our story, it moved from food to people - that even if at one time, there may have been people who seemed unsafe or unhealthy, God was inviting Peter to have them be a part of a new identity.  Even sharing new foods at unfamiliar tables.
* The water chestnuts in our lives.
	* I think there are so many people in our world that we can imagine are like water chestnuts: we don’t know why we don’t like them, but we don’t see them as part of our identity.  Instead, we work to avoid them, push them to the edge of our life plates.
	* And then there are others like tomatoes - we’re convinced that they’re poison, and we will avoid them like our lives depend on it. It’s only when a few folks might be willing to take a risk and step out do we realize that they’re not poison after all, but instead meaningful parts of our lives.
	* God invites us to be the risk takers - that those we think are poison or not tasty are part of who we are.
	* So who are those folks around us?
		* Maybe it’s the kid being bullied in school.
		* Maybe it’s the kid doing the bullying.
		* Maybe it’s the person whose in the corner that no one really talks to.
		* (and, sadly, almost embarrassingly, as adults, we still have people being bullied and people doing all sorts of bullying)
		* Maybe it’s avoiding posting that one picture on Instagram, or that one post on Facebook - the ones that like to talk about other people as poison.
	* It might not always be popular or understood - that was clear when Peter got his own pushback, but what I can tell you is here, those choices should be honored and celebrated.
