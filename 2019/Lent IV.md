# Lent IV

15:1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him.
15:2 And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, "This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them."
15:3 So he told them this parable:
15:11b "There was a man who had two sons.
15:12 The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me.' So he divided his property between them.
15:13 A few days later the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country, and there he squandered his property in dissolute living.
15:14 When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need.
15:15 So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs.
15:16 He would gladly have filled himself with the pods that the pigs were eating; and no one gave him anything.
15:17 But when he came to himself he said, 'How many of my father's hired hands have bread enough and to spare, but here I am dying of hunger!
15:18 I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you;
15:19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands."'
15:20 So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him.
15:21 Then the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
15:22 But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly, bring out a robe--the best one--and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
15:23 And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate;
15:24 for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!' And they began to celebrate.
15:25 "Now his elder son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
15:26 He called one of the slaves and asked what was going on.
15:27 He replied, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has got him back safe and sound.'
15:28 Then he became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and began to plead with him.
15:29 But he answered his father, 'Listen! For all these years I have been working like a slave for you, and I have never disobeyed your command; yet you have never given me even a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends.
15:30 But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him!'
15:31 Then the father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
15:32 But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.’"

* Recapping the last couple weeks
	* Reconciled to lament, repentance, and compassion - we tend to gravitate to the last word, but each are important to each other
		* Lament - the grief of what’s happening in the world
		* Repentance - our whole change of life
* So what’s compassion?
	* The Sarah McLachlan dog commercials
	* Or, we think about something like Compassion International, with pictures of people who look like mw showing us pictures of people who don’t look like me in situations worse than ours and invites us to give money.
	* The Greek esplanchnisthē (ἐσπλαγχνίσθη) is a rare and extremely emphatic term, which means, literally, ‘his guts were ripped out,’ or even, ‘his guts were devoured.”  This is visceral feeling here, that the father has.  It’s as if his body itself is rending itself at the sight of his son coming home.  It’s primal, and it’s powerful.
	* In the NT, the word is only used about 12 times, and exclusively in the Gospels, nearly all express Jesus Christ’s feeling towards those following him, and nearly always precedes miraculous acts of care (feeding the multitudes) and healing (restoring sight to the blind).
		* When it isn’t towards Jesus, it’s used to describe three other people - the master who had just deep compassion for his servant that he forgives him his debt, the Good Samaritan story, and here, the father… it should cue us to the special nature of these other three characters then, as the possess an important quality of Jesus.  This deep, visceral feeling leads to miracle, leads to healing.  It’s compassion that upends the brokenness of this world.  Compassion might be the single most important concept for our world that can guide our actions.
* What does compassion do?
	* It sets aside judgment for restoration
		* The son practices his apology, he’s ready to make himself a servant.  And his father just goes right past it - it doesn’t even seem necessary to him.  Instead, he works towards restoration.  No “I told you so”’s, no compensation, no sentencing - just embrace.  Just welcome.  This might not mean that perhaps later on there might not be some conversation about better lifestyle management, but clearly this isn’t the time, nor the place.  The father wants to son to know how precious he is.
	* It emphasizes unity
		* The father doesn’t say “let him eat” to his servants, instead he says “let us eat” - that includes the father, the sons, the servants, everyone.  Compassion is not a one to one action.  It ripples out.  It also puts people on level footing.  When we are not judging, we are inviting.
	* It is abundant.
		* It isn’t just a small, limited display.  Compassion invites the choicest of what we have, and to give in abundance.  The best of what we have we give freely and openly.
	* It finds the life in situations heading towards death, and celebrates it - what was dead is alive again, what was lost is now found.
* The older son gives us contrast
	* His move is away in anger and judgement.  He only knows his brother by what his actions were, and not by his actions now.
		* And he even seems to embellish!
			* Ἀσώτως (riotous excess) vs. πόρνη (prostitute)
	* Emphasizes division
		* He doesn’t even come to the party!  He hears the music, keeps a distance, and asks a servant, not his father and certainly not his brother.  He seems content to stay away.
	* Refuses to give at all - in fact, it is far more about what he has not been given, what he doesn’t receive, what he doesn’t earn.  And HE gets the fatted calf?
		* The son needs to be reminded that he has the same gifts, always there.  He’s so bent towards his own perception of injury, his own sense of transactional reward for “doing the right thing” that he can see that the right thing is currently being celebrated, and he’s choosing to remove himself from the party.
	* Here’s where lament and repentance meet compassion: if we cannot grieve at the brokenness of this world, which clearly the other brother lived, and if we can’t have a life change away from the all-too-easy self-centered of our lives towards the other, than we lose the change to both give compassion and to benefit from it.
		* Compassion is the movement of hen’s wings to cover her brood, even if they don’t want to be cared for.
		* Compassion is doing the dirty work of fertilizing an unfruiting fig tree with no guarantee of its blooming, but with a deep, visceral desire to stave off its death.
		* Compassion is the father’s lavishing on the prodigal, and inviting an unrepentant brother into the same lavish feast.
		* Compassion must be is the author and catalyst of our mission.
			* It means giving up a sense of self-righteousness.
			* It means giving up a sense of self-preservation.
			* It means giving up a sense of self-division.
			* Because if you wanted to have a chance to perform the miracles of Jesus - to bring to life what we read - compassion is the closest we’ll ever get as humanity.

* FOR TONIGHT:
	* We as the western church are almost always predisposed to be the brother and not the father, especially in a place like Delaware County, the richest county in the state, and one of the wealthiest in the nation.
		* So easy to think we need to protect what we have.
		* So easy to push out what we think is wayward and riotous under any variety of terms.
		* And we get the privilege of pushing those who we perceive as the prodigal sibling out towards our peripheral view, momentarily exposing ourselves perhaps only to ensure that we’re still doing okay.
	* We speak the stories of mission and compassion, but only as far as our own sensibilities will take us.  But our desire to sustain and survive means we living to stave off death and not living as though there could be resurrection.
	* The question must always be how far are we willing to go - do we have the guts to move beyond?
		* Are we willing to give the choicest of what we have for those trying to find a home?
		* Are we willing to forego the self-satisfactory “prophetic” moral voices that sound more like parroting of political stump speeches and instead embrace the exact person we’d rather avoid?
		* Are we willing to let go of our cultural need to “get what’s ours” in order to give to those who haven’t - even if they’ve squandered what they had?
	* And I would always invite the community of believers to hold us on this side of the stage accountable for this.  Are we showing you what compassion is? Are we inviting you to be the prodigal father?  If not, hold us accountable.
	* But if we want to experience the closest image of resurrection - of life from the dead, of finding the lost, we need to commit as a community to compassion.
