# Pentecost XIII

Ps 139:1-6, 13-18 and Luke 14.25-33

**Psalm 139:1-6, 13-18**
139:1 O LORD, you have searched me and known me.
139:2 You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from far away.
139:3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
139:4 Even before a word is on my tongue, O LORD, you know it completely.
139:5 You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.
139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is so high that I cannot attain it.
139:13 For it was you who formed my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother's womb.
139:14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; that I know very well.

139:15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
139:16 Your eyes beheld my unformed substance. In your book were written all the days that were formed for me, when none of them as yet existed.
139:17 How weighty to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
139:18 I try to count them -- they are more than the sand; I come to the end -- I am still with you.

**Luke 14:25-33**
14:25 Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them,
14:26 "Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.
14:27 Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
14:28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?
14:29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him,
14:30 saying, 'This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.'
14:31 Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?
14:32 If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace.
14:33 So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.

THE POINT: Transformative discipleship isn’t instant, but builds over time.

* Do you remember a time when you felt particularly “on fire” for God?
	* Maybe a conference?  After a mission trip?  
	* That fire burns!  We feel a little like Daniel… or Chaka Kahn - Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall For a chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all Through the fire Through whatever, come what may For a chance at loving you I'd take it all the way Right down to the wire Even through the fire!
	* And then life starts to happen.  It seems to be just part of our experience.  We talk about the let down.  Flames are down to embers, doused by any variety of things.  
		* Maybe we mark it up as some aberration in our lives, that isn’t real life, that we can’t sustain this really.
		* Or, maybe we chase the high.  We find outlets that become the spiritual drug for us.  Anything to find a spark to light our fire again.
* Imagining the crowds with Jesus
	* Talk about an on fire moment.  Literal Jesus selfies.
	* And then he turns around, and says “you gotta hate everything if you want to follow me.”  Who gave you life, who raised you, who is continuing your life on, hate it.  
	* Worst. Conference. Speaker. Ever.  Like taking buckets of water and slamming them down on everyone.  I’d want my money back.  I’d leave that moment.  Waste of time.  BECAUSE I DIDN’T GET THE FLAMES I WANTED.
	* Oh.
* Building forge.
	* Jesus is not proposing a one-time, feel-it-deep-in-your-soul forest fire kind of discipleship.  Otherwise, we’re looking at building foundations without towers, going to try to fight against evil without the support.
	* Chaka Kahn what are you really saying?  It sounds so good, but if you made it past a honeymoon phase of any relationship you know that moments like this might be just as apt to annoy you as romance you.
	* With any relationship we try to redirect those feelings into longer lasting flames that hopefully sustain longer.  This is at the core of what Jesus is doing here in this text. Stop being “in love” with me and “love” me.  If not, these flames are going to die down because you didn’t consider 
	* Those fires that we experience need to be cared for, preserved.  Instead of open flames, why not place them in a forge?
	* The precious piece that is you, that God has woven together cannot be shaped by one moment, but fires built over time steadily, building heat.
