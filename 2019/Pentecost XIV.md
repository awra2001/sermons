# Pentecost XIV

THE POINT: We have to keep decentering ourselves.

* Ellie
	* Would call me over and over “Mr. Anderson, this is Ellie Lawson, I just wanted to talk to you… I’m ready to leave, etc"
	* Had been in a NF for a couple years
	* Desired to be in the community again
	* Would call my friend George and me week after week and week.  She wanted to find a home.
	* But she struggled to get home.  She had a court appointed guardian.  
		* Often times are appointed because the state at some point rules that an individual can no longer care for themselves.  
		* "ultimately, a court may decide if an individual is incapacitated and will subsequently require a guardian, who may be a family member, friend, or a separate an individual from a for-profit or non-profit agency. In doing so, the court “removes fundamental rights, transferring the individual’s voice and decision making role to a substitute… \[and\] may affect a person’s right to make decisions about income or assets, health care and treatment, marriage, voting, sexual choices, participation in social networks, and routine lifestyle choices – and has been said to ‘unperson’ individuals.”
		* Sometimes this is good - and sometimes, in the case of Ellie, was a tougher point.
			* Was assigned an attorney guardian who at one point in his career bragged that he had more charges than anyone else in the country.
			*  These folks would often charge hefty consulting fees and liquidate people’s assets in order to help to pay their own charges
			* The hope was to keep them “stable,” but at the expense of what an individual may want - often someone who had no personal connection to that individual under their care.
			* So, Ellie wasn’t going without a big fight.  
				* Brought up her diabetes, her previous drug use and trafficking charges, her prostitution.
				* George and I always looking for the dignity of the individual, even if it meant more risk.  Even if it meant things not being as stable, because it meant that Ellie as a human was honored.
* Lk 
	* Folks like Ellie and countless others that still are tattooed on my heart are the reason why chapters like Luke 15 are so striking.
	* People who were literally dying for a chance to have agency in their own life.  
	* But often times, the folks we had the hardest time helping give that were the folks who had guardians who had no interest in them as people, only what they offered them.  The guardian was at the center; the person who we were speaking of in the margin.  (Even sometimes the way the meetings went - we’d talk about the person is detail without them there).
	* And certainly, for some of the guardians, the idea of people like Ellie being out in community seemed foolish, but it meant that they were who they were - and we didn’t abandon them!  We would wrap them in care and support. 
	* How often do we sit in judgement of the shepherd and his foolishness as one of the 99 in the middle of the flock?  Or how often do we wonder about the woman seeking the coin when she has most of her wealth at her disposal?  
	* It seems as though we like to determine who the sinner is at the margins, while forgetting that we too have been on the edges.  We like to point out all the issues with folks like Ellie, even if they’re not in our “club.”
	* In all of it, then, it means that the real story is lost - that God seeks the one sheep, is excited over one coin.
* Ellie
	* I wish I could tell you it was a happy ending.  She died in a different facility after a medical incident and the guardian clamping down even harder.  She is in an unmarked grave somewhere.
	* She’s one of hundreds of stories of folks I met in my time with the state.
	* Are we the guardians, or are we the shepherds?
