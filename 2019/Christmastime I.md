# Christmastime I

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship:
**Praise the LORD!  Praise the LORD!**
Everyone!  Let us praise the Lord!
Angels, sun and moon!  **Praise the LORD!**
The earth, creatures of the sea and land!  **Praise the LORD!**
Weather and mountain, food and forest!  **Praise the LORD!**
Old and young, all people, all places!  **Praise the LORD!**
**Yes, let everyone and everything praise the LORD!**

Commentary: The Call to Worship draws from Psalm 148, a particularly jubilant praise psalm.  As we celebrate the coming of the newborn king, we are reminded that the entirety of the cosmos has waited for this moment, and everything rejoices.

\* Opening Hymn: Angels From The Realms of Glory

\* Prayer of Confession
**Gracious God, through your son Jesus you call us your own.**  
**You became one of us, experienced our lives, and became a sibling to us.**
**Forgive us God, when we deny that same unity to others.** 
**Forgive us when we see those beside us as somehow less than family,**
**And help us when we forget to seek their welfare to invite them to our home with You, our safety and hope.**

Commentary: Using Hebrews 2:10-18 (another lectionary text) as its base, we are mindful of how Jesus was one of us.  In his arrival, he set a new trajectory for our lives.  But that trajectory was not meant only for us.  Now that at the threshold of our home, how do we invite others in as well?

\* Assurance of Pardon \[Adam\]
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace \[Adam\]
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Children’s Time \[Adam\]

Chorus: Dona Nobis Pacem

Prayer for Illumination: 

Guide us, O God, 
by your Word, and Holy Spirit, 
that in your light we may see light, 
in your truth find freedom, 
and in your will discover peace; 
through Christ our Lord, **Amen.**

First Reading: 
**Isaiah 63:7-9**
63:7 I will recount the gracious deeds of the LORD, the praiseworthy acts of the LORD, because of all that the LORD has done for us, and the great favor to the house of Israel that he has shown them according to his mercy, according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
63:8 For he said, "Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely"; and he became their savior
63:9 in all their distress. It was no messenger or angel but his presence that saved them; in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.

Second Reading: \[Adam\]
**Matthew 2:13-23**
2:13 Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him."
2:14 Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt,
2:15 and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I have called my son."
2:16 When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men.
2:17 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:
2:18 "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more."
2:19 When Herod died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said,
2:20 "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
2:21 Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And after being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee.
2:23 There he made his home in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazorean."

Message: 
**THE POINT: God cares for the one who must leave home; so can the church.**

	We have been on a journey - Advent was the anticipation, culminating in Christmas Eve, and now we’re in Christmas time.  We sit within the Christmas story for a couple weeks, until we celebrate Jesus’ baptism, and then we’ll spend a few week in Epiphany - what is it like to realize that Jesus is the Christ?  We’ll think through that by being “at home."
	
	But for now, we have a chance to stretch out and view this time with a little more reflection.
	
	Many of us are in the midst of a travel season.
		AAA had reported that this would be a record breaking season for travel - more than 115 million Americans were on the road this year.
		
		We go to places of warmth, of safety, of comfort, or perhaps of requirement.
		
		Today’s group is here because of celebration.  Even if you didn’t travel far, you’re here for reason.
		
		I think when we make these journeys, we’re aware of what it means. We often don’t make travel arrangements just because.  We have a method, we have a destination, we have purpose.
		
		The wise men, not necessarily knowing what they’d find completely, still had a purpose.  
		
	And it seems just as soon as we get to Christmas to reflect on the manger scene, we’re headed right back out again.
		As far as we can tell, Jesus had just been born, just a few weeks old, and is already having to leave his birthplace.
		
		He remained there for just somewhere between a few weeks to a couple yeras, but wasn’t able to return to his birthplace, but then to Nazareth. 
		
		Of course, the purpose of this trip was different - this was to save their child’s life.  To save the king.  
		
	I find it helps me to connect that journey with the journeys I take.  I leave here today to head to my family in Youngstown, then to Georgia to celebrate a wedding.  
	
	I lack the existential risk, though.  I’m not worried about my life, or of my children’s.  We’ll come home to a safe place.  Jesus could not return to his same home.  And there may be some of us here that can’t return to their home.  There are certainly people right now in the midst of refugee crises that will never be able to return home.  But we are all people of journeys, and within our story we carry the stories of refugees, of asylum seekers.
	
	So what can we do?  How do we live this story out?
		What is it like to be a place of refuge?
		
		I look at folks who have been here for decades - Max being one of them - who we can celebrate.  But it’s folks like him and so many other that have helped this church be a place where the doors are open.  Where people on their journeys might take a rest.
		
		The church has to be an Egypt for those who are fleeing the rage of the King, even if it’s a few weeks, or maybe a couple years.  
		
	This church is our home, but it’s never just our home.  It welcomes the weary traveler with open arms and cares for them away from the violence of the world.  And if we can celebrate them, so much the better.
	
	As we sit in this time, this Christmas-time, let’s look to 2020 with a fresh recommitment to that here at Old Stone, and wherever we’ll return to.  Let’s be a safe haven for all who are seeking shelter.
	

\* Hymn: What Child Is This?

\* Affirmation of Faith: \[Adam\]

**We believe in God,**
**the creator and giver of life,**
**who brought all creation to birth,**
**who mothers us and fathers us,**
**protecting, nurturing,**
**and cherishing us.**

**We believe in Jesus Christ:**
**God born among us as a fragile baby,**
**embodying both love and the need for love,**
**and calling us to rest in God**
**as trustingly as a tiny child.**

**We believe in the Holy Spirit,**
**breathed into us at our birth,**
**always drawing us on to be born again,**
**encouraging, exhorting, comforting,**
**nourishing our growth**
**and inspiring our living.**

**We believe in the reconciliation**
**of the world to God, through Christ.**
**Hunted at birth**
**and humiliated at death,**
**Christ entered our fearful darkness**
**so that we might enter his glorious light**
**and share the life of his resurrection.**

**And we believe that each new child**
**is a glimpse of the face of God,**
**a sign of the life to come,**
**and a call to live in peace**
**and celebrate living together.**

**Glory to God in the highest,**
**and peace to God's people on earth.**
**Amen.**

Commentary: Written by Nathan Nettleton, this Affirmation of Faith draws back again on our gospel text today - and reminds us of the whole story of our faith.

\* Charge and Benediction \[Adam\]

\* Postlude

Closing Commentary:  We’ve spend all these weeks speaking of journey, and then, just as we think we can celebrate being home at Christmas, we’re presented with Jesus being made to flee his home.  What a juxtaposition! But, perhaps if there’s any time to be mindful of those without a home, or those forced to be refugees, it is when we can find ourselves most comfortable.  And while refugees and their plight have become objects of political derision, we can take a moment to remember that our savior was forced to become a refugee, seeking asylum from violence. Our stories as Christians carry this reality in their narrative.  How are we able to remember this in the midst of turmoil?
