# Esther 6-7

THE POINT: Faithful strategy means something for God.

* Something that we’re good at and should do more.
	* Recent Pew reports say that those who are more religiously involved also tend to be more involved civically.  More likely to vote, to be engaged with our communities.  We develop “social capital"
		* Prior research suggests that one factor may be particularly important: The social connections that come with regular participation in group events, such as weekly worship services, Bible study groups, Sabbath dinners and Ramadan iftars.[9](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/31/religions-relationship-to-happiness-civic-engagement-and-health-around-the-world/#fn-31143-9) In an effort to understand why religion is related to happiness, Chaeyoon Lim of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Robert Putnam of Harvard University examined data from a representative sample of American adults surveyed in 2006 and recontacted in 2007. The researchers found that religious participation had a strong impact on happiness among highly religious people with many friends in their congregations, but not among those with few friends in their congregations.[10](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/31/religions-relationship-to-happiness-civic-engagement-and-health-around-the-world/#fn-31143-10)
			The friendship networks fostered by religious communities create an asset that Putnam and other scholars call “social capital” – which not only makes people happier by giving them a sense of purpose and belonging, but also makes it easier for them to find jobs and build wealth. In other words, those who frequently attend a house of worship may have more people they can rely on for information and help during both good and bad times. Indeed, a range of social scientific research corroborates the idea that social support is pivotal to other aspects of well-being. For instance, one study found that religion indirectly boosts self-reported health because highly religious people had more social capital.[11](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/31/religions-relationship-to-happiness-civic-engagement-and-health-around-the-world/#fn-31143-11) Congregation-based relationships may help parishioners cope with stress and reinforce positive health behaviors.[12](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/31/religions-relationship-to-happiness-civic-engagement-and-health-around-the-world/#fn-31143-12)
			
	* But, we often struggle with our sense of what that means corporately.
		* We often are afraid of our own political convictions… hinting on my article Friday.
		* JB Metz: 'The usual presumption of an _a priori_ “neutrality” and “political innocence” is either uncritical, or deliberately veils existing political alliances.’ - no such thing as neutrality.
		* And perhaps what we provide is something not all that meaningful… Metz: "The church is usually referred to as an organization of a backward consciousness, as the institutionalized taboo of knowledge and productive curiosity… and thus, strident critique gives way more and more to indifference or benevolent politeness – a caricature of the compassion that one brings to someone’s deathbed."
			* We know the church that sits on the hill while people are wasting away in the valleys.  If only they’d rise up and be here… well, they’ve lost the energy to do so.
			* And our willingness to sit as the “city on the hill” in its worst sense is damning for those who are unable get up there.  We’re making a point with our neutrality.
			* This is even more painful for those who God seems all too silent.  
* Living strategically WITHIN the culture.
	* Mordecai: Mordecai was an advisor to the King, within the court.  He did the right things and served well.  
	* It cost him his safety, his stability, and potentially his future.
	* But in the moment where the King needed to remember, he did.  And it was Mordecai’s faithful strategy that led Xerxes to where he’s at now.
* Living strategically OUTSIDE the culture.
	* Esther:  Esther used her position too, but on the outside of power structure.
	* She was brilliant in her trap.  And just as Mordecai’s living and serving the culture helped to demonstrate what the problem was, Esther worked around what was happen to trap Haman.  Haman was indeed powerful, and being direct wasn’t going to make a change.
* How can CAN live strategically
	* Let’s be for something that can save lives.
	* I can understand the desire for moral direction here, but how can you tell person who’s dying of thirst their folly in who they associate with?  How can you tell someone who is freezing on the side of the road that they should reassess the life choices that brought them to this point?  Even Jesus got to know “the sinners” first, much to the Pharisee’s discontent.
	* Our ability to live strategically within and outside the culture rests in our ability to call it’s “uncritical political innocence” out and provide an alternative.  Be, like Esther and Mordecai, in the right places at the right time, and strategically make choices.
	* Where we get our source and our fire is here.  Metz argues for that.
