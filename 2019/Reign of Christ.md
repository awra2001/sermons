# Reign of Christ

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer \[\]

Prelude

\*Call to Worship \[Jack\]
_Friends, let us rise worship God:_

We gather on this holy day,
**for we have seen Love crucified and raised.**
We gather around a font and a table,
**for we have known Joy through water and**
**bread.**
We gather around an ancient story,
**for we have heard Truth in the words of the**
**Scriptures.**
We gather around the Holy Spirit,
**who enlivens our hearts for the worship**
**of God!** 

Commentary: Today we mark Reign of Christ Sunday.  As we head into Advent, we are reminded of all Ordinary Time has that sustains us - resurrection, the sacraments, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit.

\* Opening Hymn: I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art

\* Prayer of Confession \[Jack\]
_Beloved siblings in Christ, let us confess our sins and brokenness, saying:_
**Eternal God, we thank you that you have redeemed us.**  
**You gather, you rescue, and you hold us in the midst of our difficult days.**  
**Even in the darkest moments, you give us the hope of your salvation.**  
**Lord, forgive us when we forget.  Forgive us when we lose hope.**  
**Help us to find you when we find ourselves surrounded by shadows, and help us see Your beacon of light that calls us home.**

Commentary: This commentary draws on multiple lectionary passages for this week, which remind us of God as a shepherd, and Christ as King of this world.

\* Assurance of Pardon \[Adam\]
Believe this good news and give thanks:
**We are called,**
**We are beloved,**
**We are forgiven.  Amen.**

\* Passing of the Peace \[Adam\]
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Anthem: Every Day is a Gift From the Lord

Children’s Time \[Adam\]

Chorus: Amen, We Praise Your Name O God

Prayer for Illumination: \[Jack\]

O Lord, your Word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. 
Give us grace to receive your truth in faith and love, 
and strength to follow on the path you set before us; 
through Jesus Christ, **Amen.**

First Reading: \[Jack\]

**Colossians 1:11-20**
1:11 May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully
1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
1:13 He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,
1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
1:16 for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers--all things have been created through him and for him.
1:17 He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
1:18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.
1:19 For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
1:20 and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.

Second Reading: \[Adam\]
**Luke 23:33-43**
23:33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
23:34 Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots to divide his clothing.
23:35 And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!"
23:36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,
23:37 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
23:38 There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."
23:39 One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, "Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"
23:40 But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
23:41 And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
23:42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
23:43 He replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

Message: \[Adam\] The Stewardship of Hope

	Christ the King does come at a strange time for us mentally, and this passage does as well.
	
	We’re more used to heading right to Advent, and Christmas.  Thanksgiving, even.  So to have this moment here where we witness Jesus on the cross feels almost a little profane.
	
	However, if we think of this as the final day of our liturgical year, we can see how taking one last moment to remember might project us well into the new year.
	
	Advent reminds us all about an expectant hope
		We know Jesus is coming.  We prepare for Jesus’ arrival.
		
		But when we get there, we might feel a little tattered and torn.
		
		Hope often feels like such a finite resource, and it can be hard to look around and find it in steady supply.
		
		As I’ve heard many of your stories in the last couple months, I hear the world buffeting up against you.  Bad moments gone worse, and moments when you feel like the world is playing hot hands with you, waiting for the moment to slap you as you sit quietly, hands resting.
		
		Schopenhauer
			German Philosopher
			
			He who has given up hope has also given up fear; this is the meaning of the expression _desperate_. It is natural for a man to have faith in what he wishes, and to have faith in it because he wishes it. If this peculiarity of his nature, which is both beneficial and comforting, is eradicated by repeated hard blows of fate, and he is brought to a converse condition, when he believes that something must happen because he does not wish it, and what he wishes can never happen just because he wishes it; this is, in reality, the state which has been called _desperation_.
			
			It’s easy for us to fall into this desperation.  
			
		Luke
			The beginning of Luke shows a desperate, cynical time, completely devoid of hope.  
			
			Scoffing - literally turning up their nose at Jesus.  
			
			As they mock Jesus, they do it for their own pleasure.  They’re enjoying themselves in a world without hope.  
			
			One of the criminals joins in.  This seems to be the ideal of desperation as Shopenhauer talks about it.  Dealt heavy blows, why even ask for something when it’s not going to happen.
			
			BUT Yet.
				The other criminal has hope.  In the midst of sure and certain death, the other criminal has hope.  It isn’t a desperation or a resignation, but a simple request that he believes will come to be - Jesus, remember me.
				
				Jesus, himself dying, responds.  And as far as we can tell from Luke’s telling, it is the last thing he speaks to someone other than God.  Jesus’ final act is to bring comfort and realize hope.
				
		The stewardship of hope
			The difference in the two criminals is one still believed that Jesus is who he said he was.
			
			This might be why, with all the other things that we’ve spoken of about stewarding, that is the foundation of them all.  What good is caring for relationships and the Creation is all is lost and hopeless?  
			
			It is what makes us who we are as Christians - our hope in the risen Savior.  
			
			Kuyper - Not a single square info in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry, “Mine!"
			
			The one who healed at death still can give us hope, and it means that everything that we do can be a sign of the hope Jesus gives us.
			
			When we have new members, that is hope!
			
			We when give our tithes, that’s hope!
			
			When we even just show up, that’s hope!
			
			There are times it’s hard to feel it, but perhaps that’s where the other two come back into play
				When we see someone restored because of a gentle reminder that God loves them from one of you, there’s hope renewed.
				
				When we see our world healed from its scars, being more thoughtful of what we consume, we see hope again.
				
				Budgets, programs, buildings and grounds, service, leadership.  All of it are messages of a hope when at times we’d rather just give into desperation and nihilism.
				
		Advent
			Let this next few weeks be a time to fill up your hope tank.  We’re headed home again to see the newborn child.  We’ll stay at home and explore what it is to be with Jesus, and then we’ll start our journey again and we move into Lent.
			

\* Hymn: Who You Say I Am

\* Affirmation of Faith: \[Adam\]
**In life and in death we belong to God.** 
**Through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,** 
**the love of God,** 
**and the communion of the Holy Spirit,** 
**we trust in the one triune God, the Holy One of Israel,** 
**whom alone we worship and serve.**

**In a broken and fearful world** 
**the Spirit gives us courage** 
**to pray without ceasing,** 
**to witness among all peoples to Christ as Lord and Savior,** 
**to unmask idolatries in Church and culture,** 
**to hear the voices of peoples long silenced,** 
**and to work with others for justice, freedom, and peace.** 
**In gratitude to God, empowered by the Spirit,**
**we strive to serve Christ in our daily tasks** 
**and to live holy and joyful lives,** 
**even as we watch for God's new heaven and new earth,** 
**praying, “Come, Lord Jesus!”**

**With believers in every time and place,** 
**we rejoice that nothing in life or in death** 
**can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.**

**Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.**

Commentary:  Our affirmation comes from the Brief Statement of Faith.  In 1983, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) was formed by the reunion of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Integral to reunion was the preparation of a brief statement of faith. While recognizing realities of diversity and disagreement in both the church and the world, members of the drafting committee sought to articulate Presbyterians’ common identity. Affirming at its beginning that “In life and death we belong to God” (10.1, line 1) and, at its end, that “nothing in life or in death can separate us from the love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord,” (10.05, lines 78, 79) the Brief Statement of Faith concludes liturgically with the church’s familiar doxology of praise and thanksgiving.

Closing Commentary:
At the conclusion of the Christian year, the church gives thanks and praise for sovereignty of Christ, who is Lord of all creation and is coming again in glory to reign (see Revelation 1:4-8).  The festival of Christ the King (or Reign of Christ) ends our marking of Ordinary Time after the Day of Pentecost, and moves us to the threshold of Advent, the season of hope for Christ’s coming again at the end of time.
The day centers on the crucified and risen Christ, whom God exalted to rule over the whole universe. The celebration of the lordship of Christ thus looks back to Ascension, Easter, and Transfiguration, and points ahead to the appearing in glory of the King of kings and Lord of lords. Christ reigns supreme. Christ’s truth judges falsehood. As the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, Christ is the center of the universe, the ruler of all history, the judge of all people. In Christ all things began, and in Christ all things will be fulfilled. In the end, Christ will triumph over the forces of evil.
Such concepts as these cluster around the affirmation that Christ is King or Christ reigns! As sovereign ruler, Christ calls us to a loyalty that transcends every earthly claim on the human heart. To Christ alone belongs the supreme allegiance in our lives. Christ calls us to stand with those who in every age confessed, “Jesus Christ is Lord!” In every generation, demagogues emerge to claim an allegiance that belongs only to God. But Christ alone has the right to claim our highest loyalty. The blood of martyrs, past and present, witnesses to this truth.

Questions for Reflection:

1\. What metaphor would you use today in place of or to complement the biblical use of “shepherd” to describe God’s attentiveness, love and care? (Jer 23:1)
2\. If God is our “refuge and strength,” how do you let that promise spill over to others through your being a refuge and strength for other people in trouble or need? (Psa 46)
3\. When was a time God, through your faith in Christ, rescued you from darkness and temptation? (Col 1:11)
4\. Why do you think the cross became the central symbol and representation of Christianity, faith and the church, instead of the empty tomb? (Luke 23:33)
