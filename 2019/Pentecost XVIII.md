# Pentecost XVIII

**2 Timothy 2:8-15**
2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David--that is my gospel,
2:9 for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.
2:10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
2:11 The saying is sure: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us;
2:13 if we are faithless, he remains faithful-- for he cannot deny himself.
2:14 Remind them of this, and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words, which does no good but only ruins those who are listening.
2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly explaining the word of truth.

**Luke 17:11-19**
17:11 On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.
17:12 As he entered a village, ten lepers approached him. Keeping their distance,
17:13 they called out, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
17:14 When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were made clean.
17:15 Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.
17:16 He prostrated himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan.
17:17 Then Jesus asked, "Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they?
17:18 Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"
17:19 Then he said to him, "Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”

* This is a story often focused on one particular part - the Samaritan that comes back.
	* Rightly so - it’s an important part of this text.
	* Once again we see the foreigner, the one that should be derided (Jews saw Samaritan’s as “suspect and degenerate”)
	* This is probably the one that should be least likely to recognize God’s grace, but he does anyway.  And this should be a cue for us - those who were not suppose to understand Jesus did.  Same today.
* But that’s only 10% of the total individuals healed in this story (sounds like a bad meme on Facebook - only 10% will share on their wall).  What of the fate of the nine?
	* They asked for Jesus’ mercy, and as they went to the priests, they were made clean.
	* What’s different here is that the group saw Jesus as a master.  The word used here isn’t the typical “Rabbi,” but something different to describe a headmaster or superintendent
		* The group saw Jesus as some sort of healing teacher, but not God.  The Samaritan did.
		* That the others did not see God in this healing moment is odd, but this may be just as much to indicate the Samaritan’s understanding.
	* There is nothing here that indicates to us that anything changed for the nine.
* This is God’s nature.
	* It’s important to notice that it’s the Samaritan’s faith that makes him well.
	* Because if we are faithless, God remains faithful to us - God cannot deny himself.  God will not stop being who God is.  Loving, just, merciful, healing.
	* Our own faith is not a determinant of what God will do.  When we stumble, when we forget, God will still be God.  God’s love is not contingent on us!
* Wrangling over words
	* But we can tend to want to believe that it is.  
	* We can get ourselves caught up that the service we do in the church comes with strings.  That people should join, or people should change, or people should say thank you.
	* And yeah, hopefully they do all of that.  But God will still be God if they don’t do any of that.  In fact, short of denying (which is more of an active disowning, not just forgetfulness), God will be with us.
	* Instead, let’s work to be workers unashamed.  That are happy to give no matter what.
	* Back to the meme to close.
		* Any of us on Facebook see these all the time.  And, yes, maybe 10% will share.  But there are 90% who will still be loved
