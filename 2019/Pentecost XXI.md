# Pentecost XXI

**Luke 19:1-10**
19:1 He entered Jericho and was passing through it.
19:2 A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich.
19:3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature.
19:4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way.
19:5 When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today."
19:6 So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him.
19:7 All who saw it began to grumble and said, "He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner."
19:8 Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, "Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much."
19:9 Then Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.
19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.”

THE POINT: Stewardship means stewarding the relationships of others.

* We love redemption stories.
	* Often think about the most highly rated movies, and so many of them have a focus on redemption
		* The Shawshank Redemption
		* It’s a Wonderful Life
		* The Green Mile
		* To Kill A Mockingbird
	* There’s something beautiful about seeing someone who has every reason to be rejected come through in the end.
	* These people become beautiful object lessons for us.
* It’s why we love Zacchaeus
	* Last week we talked about tax collectors, and that can still be in our heads.
	* We want the people who have been on the fringes of the society for their wrongdoing to be redeemed.  Recognize their wrong and do something about it.
	* And our readings usually give us that.  
	* View this story in your head!
	* However, in this passage, we find that our English translation fails us.
* Zaccaheus is doing.
	* In our tranlastions (and really most English translations) we notice something interesting
	* Zaccaheus’ responses are future tense!
	* But in the Greek, they are present tense
	*  So now, Zacchaeus is saying “Look, have of the things I am possessing, Lord, I give to the poor.  If I defrauded anyone or anything, I pay them back four times as much."
	* The scene shifts.  This isn’t Zacchaeus being redeemed.  Z in fact is the one, similar to last week, that already seems justified.
	* Instead, it’s the crowd who may be in need of redemption.  
	* And it reshapes Jesus remark.  Z is a son of Abraham.  The house may be the crowd.
* Stewarding relationships.
	* This can be so easy for us, too.
	* We project redemption to others, and we find ourselves nestled in the crowd.
	* Or, perhaps, we find ourselves looking to climb trees to look on what’s going on, when really, it’s our story that needs told.
