# Pentecost XXII

**THE POINT: Creation stewardship is who we are, who we’ve always been, even as it’s marred by brokenness.**
**Genesis 1:26-30**
26 Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”
27 So God created humankind in his image,
in the image of God he created them;
male and female he created them.
28 God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” 29 God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.

**Luke 12:42-48**
42 And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and prudent manager whom his master will put in charge of his slaves, to give them their allowance of food at the proper time? 43 Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives. 44 Truly I tell you, he will put that one in charge of all his possessions. 45 But if that slave says to himself, ‘My master is delayed in coming,’ and if he begins to beat the other slaves, men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk, 46 the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and put him with the unfaithful. 47 That slave who knew what his master wanted, but did not prepare himself or do what was wanted, will receive a severe beating. 48 But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will be demanded. 

	The Vegetable Battle Lines
		There’s one place that the lines are deeply drawn in my family, and that’s with tomatoes.
		
		Ask any of the boys in the family and they’ll gladly eat as many as possible.
		
		The girls in the family not so much.  To the point where Frankie is repelled by them.  If they’re in a salad she won’t eat the whole salad.
		
		But, there actually seems to be one place in the tomato battle we can generally agree - the fresh August tomato.
		
	Stewards of the good things
		Look at the order of things here.  We are in the garden still.  Gen 2:1 says “thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array” - THERE WAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
		
		And before the fall, God gave us a charge - to flourish.  And we are sent out in the garden, before the fall, to “work it and take care of it.”  We were called to be holy servants of good flourishing of all things.
		
		As the image-bearers of God, we were here to care for the world and use it in service of God.  
		
		We were meant to be cultivators.
			Taking potential in seed form
				God is gloried when we take this and that and trust God in the thus and so.
				
				And then we become blessed because of the cultivation!
					The November tomato vs the August tomato - is it edible?  Yes.  Is it the same flourishing?  No.
					
					Our call can be to take the seeds of the Creation and assist them in becoming their fullness.  That blesses all of us.
					
	The turn of brokenness
		Yet, we don’t live in the garden anymore.
		
		Our brokenness has clouded our vision, yet it doesn’t mean that we still aren’t meant to be image bearers, nor does mean we’re not meant to be cultivators
		
		It just has meant that it’s more difficult.  That our cultivation for unlocking God’s full potential in the Creation has often become for our own gain.
			It’s great that we have found a way to use oil from the ground to move society forward, but it seems to have come at a heavy price in the air and soil
			
			It’s great that we can now feed the whole world cheaply from any source, but it seems to have exacted a burden on the animals that are in factory farms
			
			It’s great that we’ve been able to subdue deserts and live in them, but it seems to have meant that we now have verdant grass growing in places it wasn’t meant to.
			
		We can so easily fall into a stupor of drinking and eating and violently exploiting others in the time between the garden and the New Jerusalem when Jesus returns.
		
		But we’ve been given so much!  The keys to the entire Creation!
		
	Our Call
		As we think about our call to Stewardship of Creation, we remember that we, too, are part of the Created.  The distance between us and the tomato is way, way closer than either the tomato and us and God.
		
		We are called to be the image bearers of a Holy God who created this world good and very good.
		
		In the time now, after the fall but before Christ returns, our call to be Stewards means that we have to find a balance in the flourishing of all Creation as much as we can.  It means we work to minimize exploitation.
		
		Our denomination has made this a priority, too.  Only three churches in our presbytery have taken on the pledge to become an Earth Care Congregation.  It means taking seriously our call to this kind of stewardship through worship, education, facilities, and outreach.  This is something we could join our cousin church in doing!
		
		And let’s not forget last week, too.  Our call to stewarding relationships means we can seek flourishing in each other.  If you feel like you don’t know someone else well, ask them if they want to go to lunch.  Ask them to get a coffee.  Sit with them after church!
