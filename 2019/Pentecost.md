# Pentecost

**John 14:8-17, (25-27)**
14:8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied."
14:9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
14:10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.
14:11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, then believe me because of the works themselves.
14:12 Very truly, I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I do and, in fact, will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father.
14:13 I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14:14 If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it.
14:15 "If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever.
14:17 This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.
14:25 "I have said these things to you while I am still with you.
14:26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and remind you of all that I have said to you.
14:27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.

* This Holy Story leads us to here, to Pentecost.  It’s all well and good to have a Christ resurrected, but this week and next, we’ll walk through what it means to have This Holy Story be ours.
* We don’t do the Holy Spirit ‘round these parts.
	* It’s not that we don’t believe in it, or value it, but we might have some struggle in understanding it or we see some of the other ways we hear about churches that are “full of the Spirit” and it can feel a little nerve-racking for us.  
	* And I think that’s usually because of how we talk about Pentecost today - almost always looking to the Acts text first, and it does sound a little wild.  
	* I think John gives us another view of the Spirit that may give us some other perspective.
* The Advocate
	* The Holy Spirit in this passage goes by a few names - Advocate, Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit.
	* The word Advocate in Greek can take on a bunch of different meanings too - some legal (counselor, advisor), but also things like guide and teacher and interpreter.  And we even see more things it can do in the text - reminder, companion.
	* This is an all-encompassing companion on a journey of faith that is, quite literally, the Trinity with us.  No wonder Jesus thinks it’s better that he go!  
	* And, it’s something that causes us to see differently than the rest of the world.  “The world cannot receive, because it neither sees nor knows”… we can place that on everyone else, or we can recognize that it means there is a responsibility on us.  That we _do_ happen to see differently.  That the Holy Story being ours means there’s a responsibility.  That we have the sight of Jesus on this world.
* The Campfire
	* Nothing is more enjoyable on the shoulder seasons of summer than cool night campfires.  I love bundling up in the dark and have a fire with friends.  
	* People do look different around a campfire.  The orange hues are more intimate that the painfully white glows of fluorescent office lamps.
	* And it’s interesting how people look differently depending on what side of the fire they’re on.
		* When they’re around me, looking at the same firelight, they become silhouettes with a ring of firelight around them.  They’re similar but illumined.
		* On the other side, however, I see the person fully awash in firelight.  They’re warmed by the intimate glow of fire, and we share that same fire, too.
		* So it is with this new sight from the Spirit.  
			* When we look at those who are sat near us, our divisions start to fade a little and instead can be replaced by the aura of the Spirit around us.  We’re not the exact same, but so many of those differences fade as we witness the Spirit within us.
			* When we look through the fire of the Spirit to others, we seem them as fully illumined, that they are not left to the dark, but can live with the light of Spirit over them.  Are they still who they are?  Sure.  But maybe that’s not the most important thing.  Maybe that’s how Jesus in his ministry could sit next to so many and share meals with them where all the “rest of the world” saw was a different class of people who they thought were below them.  
			* And if you wanted to know what “far greater” looks like, imagine a world where we saw others that way all the time.  What would it look like to see everyone else as Spirit washed,  even if they might not see it themselves?  
* So What?
	* The Holy Spirit isn’t something that is far off, doing wild things - or at least in how we too often think of it.
	* Instead, the Holy Spirit is helping us see resurrection.  That may be more wild and outlandish.
	* Try something this week: look at the newspaper, and look at the characters in the story.  Imagine them around a campfire with you.  Think about those across, where you have to look through the Spirit to see them - what would change if you knew the Spirit light was awash on them?
	* A good exercise close to home: the drag makeup class
		* Who’s on the other side?  The people who support or the people against it?  
		* What does it mean for you to see with the Spirit where others can’t?  What would it change in you?
		* If we, with God’s help, can live into that change, we were could change the world.  Thanks be to God.
