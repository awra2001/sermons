Journey of The Magi - TS Eliot **\[Jeff\]**

Sermon

* We’ve been moving quickly today through our service!  We’re on a journey, walking through all of these important parts of who we are.
* I wonder what the magi knew.
	* Of course we read what they say in Scripture - we’ve seen a star in the eat, it’s the king of the Jews.  But really, what did they know?
	* But they didn’t have the benefit of the Magnificat, the angels and the shepherds.  
	* They didn’t have the commentary that we had.  So at best, they’re going on a star and a hope.
* Eliot paints the picture of the journey.  It was a bad time, but they went.  It was a difficult journey but they went.  And the poem ends on this interesting tone:
	* were we led all that way for
	* Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,
	* We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
	* But had thought they were different; this Birth was
	* Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
	* We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
	* But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
	* With an alien people clutching their gods.
	* I should be glad of another death.
* Something is changing.  Something will change.  Perhaps not today, not tomorrow, but the world they knew is going to drift away.  And this was nothing something they would have been thinking of before they left - before they made the choice to depart.
* We are the magi.
	* We are wise people, moving a journey, not completely sure of the destination
	* Maybe you came here tonight out of obligation, out of tradition, maybe out of expectation.  But you came on a star and a hope.
	* And something has changed - did the magi know that this was the child that would deliver the entire world?  That would set ablaze multiple millennia old change in the entire world?  That would mean we’d get together in a corner of Delaware County to worship again and again?
* There is something happening tonight.  And it will happen.  Let it affect you.  Taste communion.  Witness the
