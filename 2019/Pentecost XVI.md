# Pentecost XVI

**Jeremiah 32:1-3a, 6-15**
32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
32:2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah,
32:3a where King Zedekiah of Judah had confined him.
32:6 Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me:
32:7 Hanamel son of your uncle Shallum is going to come to you and say, "Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours."
32:8 Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, "Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself." Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
32:9 And I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
32:10 I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.
32:11 Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy;
32:12 and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard.
32:13 In their presence I charged Baruch, saying,
32:14 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.
32:15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.

**Luke 16:19-31**
16:19 "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.
16:20 And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,
16:21 who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man's table; even the dogs would come and lick his sores.
16:22 The poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.
16:23 In Hades, where he was being tormented, he looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.
16:24 He called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in these flames.'
16:25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.
16:26 Besides all this, between you and us a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.'
16:27 He said, 'Then, father, I beg you to send him to my father's house--
16:28 for I have five brothers--that he may warn them, so that they will not also come into this place of torment.'
16:29 Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets; they should listen to them.'
16:30 He said, 'No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
16:31 He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"

* Inequality is nothing new for society.  Circumstances lead to different people having different things.  Even in the stories in the gospel we often meet those who have means and those who don’t.
* Often, Jesus isn’t commenting on wealth itself, but often the consequences of it.
* Our story today has us think of two things, the gate and the chasm
* The Gate:
	
	* The gate is the dividing line in our story.  On the inside is opulence - of more than more than enough - and outside is a hunger such that Lazarus leaves his open wounds to the dogs.  
	* That gate stays with the rich man.  We can imagine that he left from time to time.  He was aware of Lazarus enough that later, he seems to know his name, but the rich man does nothing.  It closes him in, and somehow to avoid providing any help.  In fact, his view - even into death, was as though it were his needs that should be served.  Lazarus needed to come to him to be satisfied, Abraham needed to send someone to his brothers.  
	
	* Overt time, that gate begins to build a chasm.  
* The Chasm:
	* This seems to take the rich man by surprise - as if somehow he hadn’t notice that, even after death, there isn’t some kind of distance between him and Lazarus.  
	* And now, this chasm “has been fixed"
		* The passive perfect.  The action has been completed, but perhaps that chasm wasn’t always fixed. That there could have a been a time when the separation between us wasn’t so insurmountable.  That the gate didn’t have to be so sure.
		* The rich man had the tools in front of him to reduce the chasm! And it wasn’t the miraculous, but “Moses and the prophets.”  The text, the stories how God has cared for us.
* A Solution to Move the Chasm:
	* The story here in Jeremiah seems a little strange.
	* In the midst of the Kingdom collapsing, here’s some land.  It comes to Jeremiah, in prison, and he decides to buy it for a relatively small price.
	* But it seemed outlandish to buy the land and hope for something better.
	* At times, the thing we’re called to do is the thing God puts in front of us, even if it seems outlandish, but it trusts the future promises of God.  That in collapse there is rebuilding, in the midst of broken lives there can be restoration.
	* We have to decide whether we stay within our gates that lead to chasms, or to build something more.  This should be on our minds as we head into a season of planning.
