# Epiphany V - The Process of the Impossible

**5** Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, 2 he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. 4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.” 5 Simon answered, “Master, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.” 6 When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break. 7 So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. 8 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!” 9 For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken; 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.” 11 When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.

* Recap from last week
	
	* Some folks have taken some time to circle back to me about the sermon
	* They started praying for folks that they wouldn’t ordinarily think to
	* And, of course this week, God had placed some of the particular people in my life I often struggle with, and I had to think about the impossible for them too.
	* The times you have to say “I need to love them as much as Jesus loves them” as much as a reminder as opposed to fact.
	* It’s not easy, though.
	* There’s these moments in ourselves that I think we want to be better than we are.  
	
	* But I think there’s a deeper, more significant statement that we carry in our hearts - that somehow, we’re not going to be good enough
	* And when that translates to faith, it can come out in belief that though this whole Jesus thing sounds good, it’s not realistic.
	* Are we able to live this life Jesus calls us to?
	* Tl;dr: Yes, but it requires something of us.
* In the places where we are, in a remarkable way, Jesus calls us as we are to live in a remarkable way. 
	* “Put out in the deep water and let your nets down for a catch"
		* Jesus calls us in the places where we are.
			* Simon Peter wasn’t asked to do be something he wasn’t right away.
			* Jesus encounters him in the normal, every day circumstances.
			* Here’s one of those stories we tell ourselves - that we have to do something incredible.  Maybe we don’t.  Maybe we just do what we are called to.
	* “We have worked all night long but have caught nothing"
		* This is the honest response to the remarkable request that Jesus asks of us.
		* Our boxes can sometimes betray us here too.  Like, Jesus would want us to do that?
			* That ministry didn’t work
			* No one will show up to this thing
			* The Spirit leads us
			* And if we don’t put the net in we’ll never know.
	* “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!"
		* Who are we to decide who Jesus cannot call into ministry?
		* Who are we to decide all of the sudden that Jesus can’t call us?
		* Sometimes it’s an honest admission of what we see as our brokenness and inability
		* At its worst, it’s a self-centered approach of protection (keystone and foundations staying firm)
		* Jesus doesn’t call the qualified, he qualifies the called.
			* And if you want to have a quick summation of most of the Hebrew Scriptures, that’s your line.
			* And Paul reminds us of that too.
		* Jesus’ response, too
			* Not shaming Peter
			* Not even forgiving him
			* There’s work to do.  
* Our Application: we can be part of the impossible
	* The impossible is not just about the moment, but about everything we do after that moment.
	* What if Peter had stayed?
		* Not cast the nets again?
		* Lived only in his sinful nature?
		* Jesus would continue his ministry, sure, but Peter’s story would have been not nearly the same.
		* Where’s the nudge this week in the ordinary?
			* Reaching out one last time to someone
			* Going to that meeting, that study, that whatever
			* Mailing that last card
			* We never know when that’s our moment.
