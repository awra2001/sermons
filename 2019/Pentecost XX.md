# Pentecost XX

THE POINT: We’re always reforming.

**Luke 18:9-14**
18:9 He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt:
18:10 "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
18:11 The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
18:12 I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.'
18:13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.”

* It’s quite an intersection of days today:
	* Reformation Sunday - a day where we mark the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, just over 500 years ago
	* Today we also gather for a congregational meeting where we will elect leaders for the church
	* We also will start the process to welcome new members into the congregation.
* We are always moving, always changing, always becoming new.
	* This is at the core of the Reformation: _Ecclesia Reformata, Semper Reformanda_: The church reformed, always reforming was the great motto of the reformation.
	* It’s a reminder that we constantly have to look to the past, and present, and future, needing to see what has truly mattered and take away those things that don’t, and the times that we skew those things that matter to fit what we want.
* Luke
	* In our text today, we read a parable that isn’t shocking for us to hear
		* The Pharisee, who would have been a preeminent follower of the rules, reminds everyone of how he follows the rules.
		* Then, he also sets out those who he perceives don’t follow the rules - the thieves, the rogues (which is more like those who are crooked and unjust, not playing by the rules), adulterers - or even like this tax collector.
		* This is his prayer to God.
		* But, meanwhile, it is the one that is the presumptive worthless, neer-do-well that is the one who has been shown to live the law.  The one on the margins, the one that would supposed by the insiders to be on the outside.
	* What is just as interesting though is how Luke is specific about who is receiving the parable:  those who trusted (had faith) in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt (“set as nought”)
* There are limits to the faith we can place in ourselves and what we believe is our own righteousness - especially when it moves towards the presumed worthlessness of others.
* But the gift of reformation - the gift of Luther and Calvin and Knox - is that we have a chance to renew, and grow.
