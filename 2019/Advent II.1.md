# Advent II

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
**The calf and the lion and the falling will lie down together,**
**And a little child shall lead them.** 

Commentary: We continue to begin our worship with Isaiah’s reminder of the one who is to come.

Candlelighting II: Fellowship Committee

\* Opening Hymn: Lift Up Your Heads

\* Prayer of Confession

Trusting in God’s grace, let us confess our sin.
**We hear of wolves laying with lambs,**
**Yet we struggle to believe.**
**We hear of Christ’s coming,**
**Yet we struggle to believe.**

**God of the impossible,**
**Bring us new hope,**
**Remind us that you love and guide us,**
**Even when we struggle to believe.**

Commentary: This Sunday, as we continue to head towards home, we’re mindful of the ways that we can struggle with our orientation.  Yet throughout history, God leads God’s people.  Even in the midst of struggle to believe in the impossible, we can rest and be sure that God will still do as God said. 

\* Assurance of Pardon \[Adam\]
The wilderness will rejoice;
the dry land will blossom.
The people of God will return
with joy and singing.

In the name of Jesus Christ, we are forgiven!
**Thanks be to God**. 

\* Passing of the Peace \[Adam\]
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Anthem: Follow The Christmas Star

Children’s Time \[Adam\]

Chorus: Dona Nobis Pacem

Prayer for Illumination: 

Creator of the stars,
in the stillness of this moment we wait;
in the stillness of this moment we listen.
As we hear the words of Scripture and sermon,
we wait for your living Word;
we listen for the cadence of your voice.
Break into our lives with your eternal light
and teach us your ways
that we may walk in your paths of truth. **Amen.** 

First Reading: 
**Romans 15:4-13** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Romans/Rom 15]]
15:4 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.
15:5 May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,
15:6 that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
15:7 Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
15:8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,
15:9 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name";
15:10 and again he says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people";
15:11 and again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him";
15:12 and again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse shall come, the one who rises to rule the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall hope."
15:13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Second Reading: \[Adam\]
Matthew 3:1-12 [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Matthew/Matt 3]]
While Jesus was living in the Galilean hills, John, called “the Baptizer,” was preaching in the desert country of Judea.

His message was simple and austere, like his desert surroundings: “Change your life. God’s kingdom is here.”

John and his message were authorized by Isaiah’s prophecy: Thunder in the desert! Prepare for God’s arrival! Make the road smooth and straight!

John dressed in a camel-hair habit tied at the waist by a leather strap. He lived on a diet of locusts and wild field honey.

People poured out of Jerusalem, Judea, and the Jordanian countryside to hear and see him in action.

There at the Jordan River those who came to confess their sins were baptized into a changed life.

When John realized that a lot of Pharisees and Sadducees were showing up for a baptismal experience because it was becoming the popular thing to do, he exploded: “Brood of snakes! What do you think you’re doing slithering down here to the river? Do you think a little water on your snakeskins is going to make any difference?

It’s your life that must change, not your skin!

And don’t think you can pull rank by claiming Abraham as father. Being a descendant of Abraham is neither here nor there. Descendants of Abraham are a dime a dozen.

What counts is your life. Is it green and blossoming? Because if it’s deadwood, it goes on the fire.

“I’m baptizing you here in the river, turning your old life in for a kingdom life. The real action comes next: The main character in this drama—compared to him I’m a mere stagehand—will ignite the kingdom life within you, a fire within you, the Holy Spirit within you, changing you from the inside out.

He’s going to clean house—make a clean sweep of your lives. He’ll place everything true in its proper place before God; everything false he’ll put out with the trash to be burned.”

Message: “Finding the Roads to Home”
**THE POINT: The** **people** **in the text guide us on our journey.**

	We are continuing our journey - we’re heading to the comfort of being with the Savior.
	
	When you begin the journey, one of the first things we think about is the transportation and also how we intend to direct it.
		Riding a train or a plane: you are moving point to point.  
		
		And if you are using one of those, it’s more than likely you’ll have to then get a car to move to your final destination.
		
		Maybe you’ll rent a car, but there’s also a chance you take a cab or maybe grab an Uber.
		
		For those of you that haven’t done that, here’s how it works...
		
	John our Uber Driver
		Imagine if you’re looking to head home, exhausted from your journey, and here rolls up your driver.  
		
		You saw his name was John.  Seemed super popular as a driver, highly rated. You see him, and realize that before you couldn’t make out his outfit.  He seems a little rough around the edges.  He’s snacking on something, maybe it’s a bug?  But, you’re not one to judge, so you get in.
		
		You say you need to head a specific direction - you know this path, you’ve been here before.  And what does he do?  NO.  YOU CAN’T GO THAT WAY!  YOU HAVE TO RECONSIDER!
		
		Who does this guy think he is?  You just want him to take you where you need to go!  In your wisdom, you let him know that, well, he might be wrong.  And he calls you a viper!  You are venomous to him!  You will inject poison!  And, moreover, he tells you that you knowing this area means not much of anything - people visit here all the time, they can get to know it pretty well too.  You’ve already given him one star and are ready to report him.
		
		But then he tells you there’s a better way to home than the one you’re accustomed to.  That there’s something more out there - almost unimaginable.  A place where your family is.  Better roads, more beautiful scenery.  You still are probably going to give him one star, but maybe you’re intrigued if you’re not too scared.
		
		And he’s right.  And as you journey with him you feel something almost familiar to him.  He takes you home finally, and says don’t worry about the payment.  He’s already received his reward in full.
		
	Our companions on the journey.
		We talk a lot about how this journey towards home doesn’t have to be done alone.  We talk a lot about the people beside us.  But there are people who have gone before us too.
		
		Romans today reminds us of that - our Scripture isn’t just a rule book or an instruction manual, or even a GPS.  But instead, it is the stories of hundreds of people - good, bad, and otherwise - who are living in response to God.
		
		Each of these people can be as close to us today as the person driving us home.  The one teaching a class, or fixing a meal.  Advent invites us into a unique opportunity not to just see these folks as artifacts in history, but friends in faith being brought alive again.  After all, that’s why we celebrate a baby being born over and over again.
		
		Sometimes it requires a wholesale reconsideration of our ways - John demands that from us.  David demonstrates it.  It could be the boldness of Abraham, or Moses.  It could also be the boldness of them within their fear.  But, as Christians, if we believe that the center of our faith is this one John is saying is coming, then perhaps each of these characters comes with us, too.  Perhaps the “great cloud of witnesses” that gets talked about is heading to where we’re going.  That maybe it’s not a straightforward journey - it requires U-turns and recalculations and pulling out the map again and again.  But we can head that way, and we have examples along the way.
		

\* Hymn: Hope is Dawning

\* Affirmation of Faith: \[Adam\]
**We believe that God has entrusted the church**
**with the message of reconciliation**
**in and through Jesus Christ.**
**We believe that the church is called**
**to be the salt of the earth**
**and the light of the world.**
**We believe that the church is called blessed**
**because it is a peacemaker.**
**We believe that the church is witness**
**both by word and by deed**
**to the new heaven and the new earth**
**in which righteousness dwells.** 

Commentary:  This Affirmation draws from The Confession of Belhar.  Added in 2016 to our Book of Confessions, it was an effort for the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa to speak against Apartheid.  We can imagine a world that no matter our background, we can find a home in Jesus Christ.

Closing Commentary: This week, we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about direction.  Whether it’s tuning our maps and GPS’s, or looking a certain direction, Advent is a time where we are moving _towards_ the Christ child.  The Christian faith is most often a faith of movement - out of the garden, out of Egypt, out of Israel and Judah, out of Bethlehem, out of Jerusalem.  Yet, there was always a place to go that God prepared, even if it wasn’t so clear at the beginning: a safe place outside Eden, a promised land, a return to home, and for Jesus a return to God where he still prepares rooms for us.  As we continue on our journey, let us rest assured that wherever we are going, God has a home for us.

Questions for Reflection:
1\. What is God's picture of our church?
2\. What is God's picture of our community?
3\. What do you think is God's picture of the world?
4\. How can we help to make that vision a reality?
