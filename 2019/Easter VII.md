# Easter VII

**Acts 16:16-34**
16:16 One day, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners a great deal of money by fortune-telling.
16:17 While she followed Paul and us, she would cry out, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way of salvation."
16:18 She kept doing this for many days. But Paul, very much annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I order you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
16:19 But when her owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
16:20 When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, "These men are disturbing our city; they are Jews
16:21 and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to adopt or observe."
16:22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates had them stripped of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
16:23 After they had given them a severe flogging, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to keep them securely.
16:24 Following these instructions, he put them in the innermost cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
16:26 Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
16:27 When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he supposed that the prisoners had escaped.
16:28 But Paul shouted in a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
16:29 The jailer called for lights, and rushing in, he fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
16:30 Then he brought them outside and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
16:31 They answered, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
16:32 They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
16:33 At the same hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and his entire family were baptized without delay.
16:34 He brought them up into the house and set food before them; and he and his entire household rejoiced that he had become a believer in God.

* This is a text that often turns on the latter half.  I remember growing up hearing about this story.  
	* The thesis always seemed similar - do the right thing.  
	* This builds on some of our time last week, too regarding evangelism.  
	* But nothing in the latter half would have happened had it not been for the first half.
* The story of the slave girl
	
	* This whole story hinges around the slave girl.
	* We don’t know a whole lot about her, except that she’s profitable.
	* According to Luke as well, she has a demon in her that would cause this her “divination to occur."
	* So she is exploited in her sickness for the economic gain of her owners.
	* Paul gets annoyed.  Paul often gets annoyed.  We don’t know precisely why, although it’s not like what the girl is saying would have hurt them in their mission.  It would seem to the contrary.  She’s selling his cause.  In this era, this kind of divination for financial gain was criticized, and so maybe he was upset about that.  Either way, he casts out what is in her.
	* And when that happens, what do we hear about her?  About nothing.  She’s worthless to her owners.  Paul and Silas are drug away.  The owners argument has nothing to do with exploitation or the wrong of what was happening with their work, just simply that “Paul and Silas are disturbing the city”.  Disturbing the way things are, even if they’re not right.  Even if they’re not the way things should be.
	* For healing the slave girl and limiting her exploitation, Paul and Silas were beaten, had their clothes stripped, and went to jail...
	
	* But do you see the life springing from the death?  This Holy Story we witness here?  This is resurrection distilled.
* Living out justice
	* Justice has become a word bandied about in lots of negative ways, and in most circles, devoid of any theological meaning.
	* This is justice.  One kind, yes, is Paul and Silas - their freedom from the prison and their care of the guard.
	* But the slave girl’s liberation is another important sense of justice as well.
		* See systemic evil and exploitation
		* Work towards corrective action
		* …and realize that the system may resist the change.
	* I hope as followers of Jesus and believers in resurrection we find that the consequences of not working towards justice in this world are greater than the consequences of doing so.
	* I hope that our recognition of the way things shouldn’t be is greater than living in the comfort of the way they are.
	* And I hope we can keep looking for the exploited slaves in our world today.  Those who are exploited for financial gain.  Those who are only known by the thing that controls them.  Known only by what they are and not who they are.
	* And let’s work to be a home on the hill for those who just recently have broken free.  Let’s not have them disappear in the history books because of later arguments.  Let’s bring them in.  There and then the resurrection will be alive in us.
