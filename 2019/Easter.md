# Easter

**Luke 24:1-12**
24:1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared.
24:2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
24:3 but when they went in, they did not find the body.
24:4 While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them.
24:5 The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.
24:6 Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
24:7 that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again."
24:8 Then they remembered his words,
24:9 and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.
24:10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles
24:11 But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
24:12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.

* Our own Easter Pilgrimage
	* This day is part of our pilgrimage, too.  We know we’ll come today because it is part of the rhythm of our lives.  We like to come on Easter, to see the lilies, have some breakfast.  We love the music.  We honor the legacy of the church in our lives.  But we don’t typically expect the miraculous here.  
	* And even what’s proposed here, on this day, is a little bit more than miraculous - life overcoming death.  So, we’re thankful for the idea, but we will maintain the path.
* But what happens when the familiar changes, like in our text today?
	* The women hear words, they have an experience, and it’s all unexpected.
	* Their first instinct is not the thing that was promised but instead confusion.
	* And so our response can be to stick to what we know, what we’ve witnessed in the past: tradition, legacy of the departed… we seek the dead amongst the living.
	* And this isn’t unfamiliar or unappreciated even in our text - this message seems like idle tales (nonsense, garbage, other stronger words to describe when someone is talking a great deal of things that don’t make sense)
	* So let’s be honest with each other that this easter message, this resurrection, this life conquering death is hard to believe, and easier imagined as fairy tale than anything else.
	* And so we either try to justify to death through all sorts of archeological or logical arguments, trying to prove something that is hard in the first place more and more until it becomes a project, or we just consign it back to the myths we tell on Sunday, toothless and banal, but nice to speak.
* But what instead of proving or disproving, we just let it be?  We let this story breathe on its own - we took it at its word, that something miraculous happened.  That the 1:infinity thing happened in a lifetime.
	* That maybe there is such thing as resurrection - life from death.
	* What would our lives look like?
		* Could it be that this story wouldn’t feel like some kind of unattainable proof to solve, but instead a life to live into?
		* Could it not feel like just a quaint thought from ancient idle tales, and instead a moment of celebration?
	* Because I think the entire creation itself craves the resurrection.  The gift of the once-dormant trees springing into life abundant.  The flowers around us and their sweet smell, once bulbs in the ground.  They, too, had the motions of winter, moving through, but now bring bright, explosive blooms.
	* Where could we spot resurrection in our everyday?
		* The forgiveness from a friend after a relationship seemed long dead
		* The return of a loved one who was wandering too long near death, but returns back to life.
		* Even just the daily growth of our children in this space are mini resurrections - life coming forth.
		* Even still, our waking in the morning is another chance to remember this story - the miraculous, life springing forth.
	* There might be a chance that these stories, this text, brings forth the very essence of life!  That in this ink is the blood of life itself.
* If we weren’t so sure, and just let it be, and allow ourselves to live there, we might see resurrection all around us.
