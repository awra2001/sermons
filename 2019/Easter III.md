# Easter III

**Acts 9:1-6, (7-20)**
9:1 Meanwhile Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
9:2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
9:3 Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
9:4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
9:5 He asked, "Who are you, Lord?" The reply came, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
9:6 But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
9:7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one.
9:8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
9:9 For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
9:10 Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."
9:11 The Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying,
9:12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
9:13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem;
9:14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name."
9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel;
9:16 I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."
9:17 So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
9:18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,
9:19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus,
9:20 and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God.”

* The story of Paul’s conversion is particularly well-known to us, in part because we know how prolific Paul is.  So much of the New Testament has his voice throughout.
* Saul/Paul was good at what he did.  He seems zealous, determined, thoughtful, logical.  He tells us as much throughout his letters.  And he might have continued on the way he was going.
* But then he met Jesus - the resurrected one - and was interrupted by This Holy Story.
* This is not a story of vengeance - remember, resurrection isn’t vengeful.  
* Paul was put in reverse.  His way was turned around.  What does it look like?  Like any other time we need to throw something in reverse.
	* Moving in a direction - Paul was looking to “bind up believers"
	* Knowing that the current direction won’t work anymore - Jesus meets Paul
	* Coming to a stop - Paul stops for three days.  And it’s everything: his sight, his motion, his eating, his mission.  Complete and total stop. 
	* Shifting the gears - Ananias laying hands.  
	* Moving in a new direction - notice that the path Saul is a totally different one - even his name is new.  
* This Holy Story - living into the resurrection - can put our lives in reverse too, but it requires us to follow the same steps.
	* We’re able to recognize the direction we’re going.  This is harder than we might realize.  We often move through life as unobservant passenger.
	* We might have a moment of recognition about our direction being untenable, but it can also be hard to come to a stop.  We make sudden shifts in direction, but often that just leads to a whiplash or an accident.
	* Finally - sometimes we can be a bit like Ananias - a different one.  We can look at those who have made changes with a certain amount of cynicism - oh, Saul?  Really?  But if we miss the folks who are turning their selves around, we’ll also miss the times that we have new companions on our own journeys - those who The Holy Story has changed, which can be one of the biggest nourishments on our walks - to see Sauls be turned to Pauls.  Just look at the story of the fire that Holly put together and you’ll see that story written throughout.
* So what now?
	* Some days we’re Paul, and some days we’re Ananias.
	* But where we witness The Holy Story the most is the in the moment realizing we need to stop and then stopping.  That three days of prayer was significant and literally life changing for Paul.  Where are the moments where we can slow, stop, be blinded from the world and be with Christ?
