# Advent I

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

\*Call to Worship
The nations shall beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks;
**nation shall not lift up sword against nation,**
**neither shall they learn war anymore.**

Commentary: As we begin our journey to Advent, we begin to walk towards home, to once again visit the Savior who will save us. 

\* Opening Hymn:

\* Prayer of Confession

Trusting in God’s grace, let us confess our sin.
**Holy God**, **we confess**
**that we do not walk in your light**.
**We hurt and destroy one another**
**and neglect the poor and hungry.**
**We let evil grow among us**
**and fail to bear good fruit**.
**Forgive us, God of grace.**
**Awaken us to your Word,**
**so that we may be ready**
**to welcome you with joy;**
**through Jesus Christ our Lord**. 

Commentary: Jesus Christ, our bright beacon guiding us home, can be shadowed by our own failing vision.  As we prepare ourselves, we can take a time for self-reflection, clear out what may be stopping us from seeing the Holy Light, and prepare for Jesus.

\* Assurance of Pardon \[Adam\]
The wilderness will rejoice;
the dry land will blossom.
The people of God will return
with joy and singing.

In the name of Jesus Christ, we are forgiven!
**Thanks be to God**. 

\* Passing of the Peace \[Adam\]
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Anthem: 

Children’s Time \[Adam\]

Chorus: 

Prayer for Illumination: 

Creator of the stars,
in the stillness of this moment we wait;
in the stillness of this moment we listen.
As we hear the words of Scripture and sermon,
we wait for your living Word;
we listen for the cadence of your voice.
Break into our lives with your eternal light
and teach us your ways
that we may walk in your paths of truth. **Amen.** 

First Reading: 
**Isaiah 2:1-5** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Isaiah/Isa 2]]
2:1 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
2:2 In days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.
2:3 Many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
2:4 He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
2:5 O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!

Second Reading: \[Adam\]
**Matthew 24:36-44** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Matthew/Matt 24]]
24:36 "But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
24:37 For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
24:38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
24:39 and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man.
24:40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
24:41 Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.
24:42 Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
24:43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.
24:44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.

Message: \[Adam\]

	The turkey this Thanksgiving.  All the work that went into it
		Three hours of prep for 25 minutes of eating and 1 hour of cleaning
		
		It was still meaningful though.  I enjoyed the time.
		
		The work matters.
		
	The prep is a moment of already-not-yet.
		When we live it for what it is, it is meaningful.
		
		Food tastes better when we make it.
		
		There is a pride when we watch others celebrate what we’ve done.
		
	We might find this text hard because it doesn’t feel Christmas-y.  It feels Advent-y
		But to step over this is like showing up 5 minutes before dinner - simple but incomplete.  
		
		Christ amplifies this in Matthew - it’ll be a completely upending, world bending experience.
		
		But the response isn’t “Don’t anticipate or don’t look forward…” it’s just don’t go into some kind of comatose state until Christ’s return.
		
	Make the turkey.  Make the stuffing.  Bring it together and share.  Beat swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks.
		Live in the already-not-yet.  And let the art happen.
		

\* Hymn: 

\* Affirmation of Faith: \[Adam\]
**We believe that God has entrusted the church**
**with the message of reconciliation**
**in and through Jesus Christ.**
**We believe that the church is called**
**to be the salt of the earth**
**and the light of the world.**
**We believe that the church is called blessed**
**because it is a peacemaker.**
**We believe that the church is witness**
**both by word and by deed**
**to the new heaven and the new earth**
**in which righteousness dwells.** 

Commentary:  This Affirmation draws from The Confession of Belhar.  Added in 2016 to our Book of Confessions, it was an effort for the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa to speak against Apartheid.  We can imagine a world that no matter our background, we can find a home in Jesus Christ.

Closing Commentary:
“Advent” means “coming” or “arrival.” During the season of Advent, we celebrate Christ’s coming into the world and watch with expectant hope for his coming again. In its historical origins, the season of Advent was patterned after the season of Lent, a six-week period of penitence and preparation for Easter. Similarly, the four weeks of Advent present an opportunity for communal discernment and personal examination, as the church prepares to celebrate the Nativity of the Lord and looks with hope for Christ’s return.

In Advent we expectantly wait for the One who has already come. We anticipate the promised justice of God’s new world, yet we praise God who raised the “righteous branch” to rule with justice and righteousness. We hope for the restoration of the afflicted, the tormented, and the grieving, yet we delight that healing has come in Christ. We long for the beating of swords into plowshares, yet we rejoice that the Prince of Peace has appeared. We yearn for the barren deserts of our inner cities to flourish, yet we laud the desert Rose that has bloomed. We dream of the land where lions and lambs live in harmony, yet we acclaim the child born to lead us into the promised land.

Christ has come! Christ is risen! Christ will come again! In Advent, we are living between the first and the second coming of the Lord. The dialectical tension of _maranatha!_ \[alternately translated “Come, our Lord!” or “Our Lord has come”\] — placing us between memory and hope, past and future — may strengthen our journey through Advent. Perhaps we need to cling to the ancient cry of _maranatha_! and its paradoxical meanings so we may freely embrace “the new thing” prophesied by Isaiah (Isaiah 43:19) that God is doing among us right now. The tension and paradox we find in Advent shapes our celebrations during the season. (From the _Companion to_ _the_ _Book of Common Worship_)
