# Hebrews 12.1

THE POINT: Heaven cheers us on, not passively.

* When you start thinking about heaven, I think one of the first things to come to mind is John Lennon’s song.  It’s the first couple stanzas.  Doesn’t seem super positive about the idea, in fact, Lennon would prefer that they didn’t exist.
* I think he may have a point, though, in his criticism of some of the ways we talk about them.
	* Heaven seems as much to be about a contrast to hell.
	* Also, in the song at least, Lennon is contrasting a world that seems meaningful and heaven-like to heaven… it’s almost like the heaven we think about is passive.
	* As a result, heaven becomes only this reward for not going the wrong direction, and working towards the right one… some kind of eternal Sabbath.
* But that’s not how we want to imagine God.
	* We fight against the idea that we have a passive God maybe we think of angels, but then we like to think of ourselves as passive.
	* We will somehow live strolling along gilded streets without a care in the world.
* Heb 12.1… the cloud of witnesses
	* Our eyes are drawn to the idea of the cloud, but the words here paint another story too.
		* These clouds of witnesses were some of the most important people in the Hebrew tradition (and by extension ours too).  They lived meaningful lives here
		* Surrounded (περίκειμαι) is a word that means wearing something, and lay aside (ἀποτίθημι) can also mean take off.
		* We are being encouraged to take off the garments of a broken, sinful life and instead replace it with our heavenly heroes.
		* They are that near to us, that critical to us.  They are our cloak, our clothing.  And they are renewing us.
* What if heaven is that near?
	* What if rejoicing is celebrating God’s justice being done in the world?
	* What if worshiping God is rejoicing in God’s handiwork?
	* What if “thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven” actually was real?
* Our summation for our month of bracket sermons
	* We are called to go, all of us, to serve the world. It’s what God wants, and the citizenship of heaven celebrates with us, moves with us, and embraces us like a favorite cloak.
