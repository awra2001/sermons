# Lent I - At Ostrander Pres

Speaking of journeys - I thought I’d tell you all a story of another journey.  How many of you have had to walk with kids for any extended period of time?  If so, then I think you’ll relate.  It begins with a dad who loves his two children very much.  This dad wants to do something special for his kids, and decides that today, they’d go for a walk so that they could get juice at the speciality juice store about a 10 minute walk away.    The dad had planned 30 minutes for the trip. He tells his children and they are excited - they hurriedly put on their shoes and begin to walk with their dad, who feels especially buoyant having delighted the kids and having an end goal in mind.

First comes the sticks on the ground.  The kids must grab a few!  Okay, one diversion; no big deal.  Then come the stones that must be thrown in the creek in order to make a wish.  The dad throws a stone in, wishing the stones weren’t there anymore so that the family would keep moving.

Then a loose shoe.  Then rocks in shoes - how many rocks are there?  Then “please put on your shoes.” Then touching-a-plant-don’t-touch-that-plant-you-don’t-know-if-it’s-poisionous-or-not-can-we-please-get-moving-please time.  The 30 minutes eclipse and the dad can still see the front door of their duplex.  He figures maybe they’ll get there in time for it to close.  Some plan.  Some dad.

Why couldn’t these children know what the dad had in store!  Why couldn’t they just want to get some juice?!  What it is about these kids that has them rather climb a tree or grab a rock than do something that they wanted, they were excited about?!  The dad began to wonder if they had conspired against them.

* This can be Lent for us
	* We know the sweet, familiar taste of Easter, and so we’d rather head there in the most direct way.  Let’s not delay with anything else.
	* All these weeks of lent can feel more like a distraction, then.  
	* The practices can feel that way, too - why give things up?  Why go through all these temporary motions.  Is it all just the things we do?
* But, as any child ends up reminding us, the journey is as important as the destination.
* So do our texts today.
	* Deut
		* God instructs the people through Moses about the things that they should do once they’ve arrived at the promise land
		* And almost all of it is related to remembering that they were people of journey
			* Into Egypt
			* And out of it
		* Our identities as people are more deeply wrapped into our journeys than we may give them credit for. 
			* I was thinking about the trip to get a new TV or chair.
			* All of things that can happen between sitting and sitting
			* But not nearly as much happens by the time we park ourselves to watch whatever we plan on watching that day.
			* But less glibly, our journeys often are more identity-shaping than the times we have reached out destination.
				* It’s not always comfortable, or easy, but it can help us understand who we are.
				* Acknowledge the same with Ostrander.  This journey isn’t easy, but it can be a more deeply shaping time than when everything is stable and unmoving.
	* Luke
		* This was the same with Jesus.  
		* In each of these temptations, Jesus could have ended his journey in his wilderness.
			* The journey made him hungry, he could have been fed.
			* The journey took him away from places of power, and he could have been given it all.
			* They journey tested him physically and emotionally we could imagine, and the devil gave him a chance in one swift motion to be attended to.
		* But each time he refused.  And it continues to shape him.
		* It also helps us to understand who we are, just as in the Deut passage.   When we gather at home, we can remember the wandering man from Nazareth who held fast from easy ways to get to the end, but instead wandered with us until the very end.
* This is why Lent is so important
	* If we only head destination to destination, we lose the opportunities to both be shaped by the journey, but also to remember how those we follow were shaped by their journeys as well.
	* And in whatever way we can, we reenact those journeys even in the midst of being at home.
	* Every time we are willing to give, to deny, to wander, we’re reminded that there are others who still are unable to find home.  
	* But perhaps there is where we find the vibrancy of life, because it’s not safe, not wrapped in layers of protection.  It’s in the wilderness between the start and ending.

Which brings us back to the story of the dad and his two children.  The dad wondered about a conspiracy against him, until he heard their laugh.  Joyful.  Alive.  The dad saw the way they moved with quickened pace towards easily climbed tree, its bark smoothed by so many children’s feet running up and down it.  How they were more at home in the moments they could move around and celebrate the world and not just head to a specific, determined destination.  How much would the dad have lost, he wondered, if he had just pushed the children like he wanted - to follow his imposed special moments towards a juice bar?  What would his children had lost?  And so, after a little bit more internal consternation, the dad finally decided that perhaps the most important thing was not getting to the store but being with his kids.  And so they swung on a swing set.  They gathered rocks.  They watched ants gather food for their nest.  They were the created and not the creators, witnessing a great God and, whether they realized it or not, remembered the God of Sabbath.  They all eventually got to the juice store, but the dad was convinced that it tasted a bit more sweet than it may have before.  Such are the gifts of grace.
