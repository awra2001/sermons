# Pentecost XVII

THE POINT: Living our lives is the testament to faith.

8/25: 

* Our fall challenge
	* As we head in the fall, I want this to be our challenge as a church.  
	* I’m going to start teaching a class about this exact topic.
	* But between here and Advent, what if focused on our intentionality?  Giving ourselves actively?  Recognizing we are enough.  That we give our lives in the ordinary, mundane ways.  What could this church look like?  What could our world look like?

\--

* “How long shall I cry” is a phrase we speak in our hearts often, whether we can speak it aloud or not.  
	* And it doesn’t matter your age or your circumstances
		* The child who is exhausted of being told “do this, do that” and says it’s the worst day ever.
		* The teenager amidst bullying and the difficult changes in friendships.
		* The young family struggling to make ends meet
		* Older adults with a new diagnosis, new treatments
	* At times we don’t speak the question because it’s hard to continually face the responses, or perhaps the silence that comes with wanting to know why we face difficult circumstances when we see others who are more corrupt and evil succeeding.
	* We might hope for the lightning bolt moment, where God is revealed, the seas part with a path that is crystal clear.  But it might not happen.
	* What do we do?
* We keep asking God.  We keep demanding from God, because it means there is still a conversation.
	* O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not listen? Or cry to you "Violence!" and you will not save?  Why do you make me see wrong-doing and look at trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.  So the law becomes slack and justice never prevails. The wicked surround the righteous-- therefore judgment comes forth perverted.
	* Hab kept asking, kept lamenting, kept pushing God.  Faith is not the same as an unequivocal blind following.  A faith unexamined and unchallenged is likely to be blown over.
* We keep watching in places where we can see.
	* We still believe in the midst of the conversation that God will respond, but not always in the way we presume, or at the time we expect.  But like last week, we keep looking what what God might place in our laps. 
	* We’re not locating ourselves out on the far spaces, the edges, to listen for God.
* We give what we have (which is always and ever enough).
	* It’s so easy to want to quantify our faith - we have measures for what we give and who attends, leadership and committees.
	* But the purpose of those metrics is not to quantify our hearts, our faith, and who we are as beloved children of God.  The apostles thought faith could be something increased, as though it had some level and point system.  But that’s not it.  It’s being who we are.
* We go and do as best we can.
	* This is where the last part of the gospel text comes in.
	* Standing at ramparts and watchtowers, doing the best with what we have, continuing to ask.  They’re not glamorous, they don’t demand attention, but they’re the foundation upon which the path we look for is built.  Our “how long shall I cry” is responded to in faith.
