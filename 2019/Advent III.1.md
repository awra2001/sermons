# Advent III

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship
Say to those of a faithful heart:
Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God.
**Behold!  The glory of the Lord shines upon us!**
Say to those with weak hands and feeble knees:
Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God.
**Behold!  In splendor the Lord dwells among us!**
The barren lands burst into bloom; the desert erupts with delight.
We join creation’s song:
**With joy in our hearts, let us worship God!**

Commentary: As we move through a journey, knowing the destination but not always knowing the next turn, we can find ourselves fearful.  Yet along the way there are ways that we can witness God with us - Immanuel.

Candlelighting III: Deacons

\* Opening Hymn: Come Thou Long Expected Jesus

\* Prayer of Confession

Trusting in God’s grace, let us confess our sin.
**Holy God**, **we confess**
**that we do not walk in your light**.
**We hurt and destroy one another**
**and neglect the poor and hungry.**
**We let evil grow among us**
**and fail to bear good fruit**.
**Forgive us, God of grace.**
**Awaken us to your Word,**
**so that we may be ready**
**to welcome you with joy;**
**through Jesus Christ our Lord**. 

Commentary: This Confession, which we have used in Advent, is another reminder of the tasks before us during the season.  While we are heading on the journey, there are others who want (and need) to come along, too.  How are we mindful of their journey, and how do we invite them as well?

\* Assurance of Pardon \[Adam\]
The wilderness will rejoice;
the dry land will blossom.
The people of God will return
with joy and singing.

In the name of Jesus Christ, we are forgiven!
**Thanks be to God**. 

\* Passing of the Peace \[Adam\]
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Anthem: Advent

Children’s Time \[Adam\]

Chorus: Dona Nobis Pacem

Prayer for Illumination: 

Creator of the stars,
in the stillness of this moment we wait;
in the stillness of this moment we listen.
As we hear the words of Scripture and sermon,
we wait for your living Word;
we listen for the cadence of your voice.
Break into our lives with your eternal light
and teach us your ways
that we may walk in your paths of truth. **Amen.** 

First Reading: 
**Isaiah 35:1-10** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Isaiah/Isa 35]]
35:1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; like the crocus
35:2 it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.
35:3 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
35:4 Say to those who are of a fearful heart, "Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you."
35:5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;
35:6 then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;
35:7 the burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp, the grass shall become reeds and rushes.
35:8 A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way; the unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for God's people; no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.
35:9 No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it; they shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there
35:10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

Second Reading: \[Adam\]
**Matthew 11:2-11** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Matthew/Matt 11]]
11:2 When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples
11:3 and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?"
11:4 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:
11:5 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.
11:6 And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me."
11:7 As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
11:8 What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces.
11:9 What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
11:10 This is the one about whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
11:11 Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

Message: “Hitchhikers"
**THE POINT: We comfort fellow hitchhikers along the journey**

	So many different images this week, and one that you can get stuck on is “Holy Way”.  Another journey image!  And these two passages are trading images with each other, all good and rich - lots of joy and singing, people healed, restored, dryness is dry no more.  And wherever this place is, there’s a highway. That’s the destination.
	
	And here, in the midst of it, we have this story of John in prison.  
		The reversal here is striking - last week he’s in the wilderness and baptizing, and this week he’s in jail.  And jail strikes me as a place where you become a bit more circumspect.  After all, he’s given himself for this cause, and now, in prison, he doesn’t have the same ability to serve.  He might second guess what the value of what he’s doing is.  
		
		Jesus responds, but not a simple “yes/no,” but instead with a description of what is happening - the dry land now glad, the desert rejoicing.  
		
	Then, Jesus speaks to a crowd. 
		Did you decide to go out on a sightseeing tour?  No, you didn’t.
		
		What did you find?  Something soft?  _Malakos -_ something weak, soft, coddled.  No!  (They don’t hang around these parts - they’re far happier to be in the safety and luxury in the royal palaces).
		
		Who you found was someone grizzled and hard.  A prophet - THE prophet who was announcing the Holy Way.  The place Jesus just told John’s disciples about.  Oh, and by the way - this amazing person John the Baptist is low man on the totem poll.
		
	Cognitive Dissonance
		So here we are - wilderness blooming, John in Jail.  All this healing, but no easy comfort.  You went in the wilderness and you met a guy in camel hair who isn’t all that high up as you might want to believe.
		
		We’re journeying, but we’re not there yet.  We have quilts for comfort in pews that might not be your first choice for comfortable seats.  
		
		Let me tell you a story:
			Someone gets ahold someone here at the church.  She’s a single mom and wants to have a chance to be out on her own, as she’s been back and forth with family members, her mom and others.  Some of the church folks get together and help find appliances which are needed so she can get approved at her inspection for her new home.  Someone took her shopping to make sure she had what she needed to care for her children along the way.
			
			This week, some folks at the church got word that the Family Promise house was lacking a dinner.  Some folks got together at the last minute and make sure those folks were fed.
			
			These are stories from just the week, and they’re the type that go unspoken and uncelebrated.
			
		The quilts we hold and are comforted by don’t tell the story of their creation, only of their comfort.
			Someone ran the thread, or knit the knots.
			
			But we see other things.  We witness the softness, the images on them.
			
			But someone had to do the work here.  Groups of people band together to do this work.
			
	The gift of our advent journey are the opportunities we have to invite others to the way.
		It means none of us are drivers on the highway, but we’re all hitchhikers, hopeful for a ride to a renewed land.
		
		It means at times we wander in the wilderness to meet others.  We build relationships.  We meet people around tables, around the corner, and we live life with them (Family Promise - celebrating a 15th birthday)
		
		And then we help to guide them to the way.  Maybe it’s here!
		
		And if we stay too long in the wilderness ourselves, we may wonder if it’s all still really true.  So we have others relay the stories again.  We try to come back to the Way again so we can go out.
		
		But that comfort, that care, is not done without its share of work.  But when the patchwork comes together, it can be as rich and as warm as all the brilliant beautiful quilts we have around us.
		

\* Hymn: Comfort Comfort Ye My People

\* Affirmation of Faith: \[Adam\]
**We believe that God has entrusted the church**
**with the message of reconciliation**
**in and through Jesus Christ.**
**We believe that the church is called**
**to be the salt of the earth**
**and the light of the world.**
**We believe that the church is called blessed**
**because it is a peacemaker.**
**We believe that the church is witness**
**both by word and by deed**
**to the new heaven and the new earth**
**in which righteousness dwells.** 

Commentary:  This Affirmation draws from The Confession of Belhar.  Added in 2016 to our Book of Confessions, it was an effort for the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa to speak against Apartheid.  We can imagine a world that no matter our background, we can find a home in Jesus Christ. 

Prayers of the People \[Adam\]

The Lord’s Prayer

Offering \[Adam\]

Doxology

\* Hymn - Come As You Are

\* Charge and Benediction \[Adam\]

\* Postlude

Closing Commentary:  While the last two weeks may have invited us to look inward, this week along the journey, we’re invited to look at those who might be on the fringes looking to join us towards Jesus.  The image on the front of our bulletin today was a comic created by Everett Patterson.  It’s interesting to imagine Joseph and Mary, who we often elevate to a cherubic status, as two everyday people just looking for a safe place to be home.  What is it like to imagine if we were headed into the convenience store and happened to see them as they are portrayed here?  How would we consider reaching out to them?  What would we do?  Would we even notice them?  What if a family we visited this week with Family Promise were a couple As we continue to journey into Advent, let’s continue to find others who may be looking for a similar home, and reach out to them as well.

Questions for Reflection:
What experiences in life give you your strongest sense of God’s presence?

When have you felt impatient with God? How did you deal with those feelings?

When you hear someone say, “The church has an important healing ministry,” what do you understand by the word “healing”?

Is there someone today you know that could use some encouragement?  A word of healing?  What do you think is the best way you show people that care?  What will you need to give that care?  What may be stopping you?
