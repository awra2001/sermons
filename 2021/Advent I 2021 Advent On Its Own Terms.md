# Advent I 2021: Advent On Its Own Terms

SO WHAT: There are reasons why we are part of this community that Advent begins to answer for us.

First Reading **Jeremiah 33:14-16** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Jeremiah/Jer 33]]
33:14 The days are surely coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
33:15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. 
33:16 In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this is the name by which it will be called: "The LORD is our righteousness." 

Second Reading **Luke 21:25-36** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Luke/Luke 21]]
21:25 "There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. 
21:26 People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 
21:27 Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in a cloud' with power and great glory. 
21:28 Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near." 
21:29 Then he told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees; 
21:30 as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. 
21:31 So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. 
21:32 Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. 
21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. 
21:34 "Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day catch you unexpectedly, 
21:35 like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. 
21:36 Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man." 

WHAT IS ADVENT?

* Before we start into the season of Advent, we might want to remind us a little more as to why we have this time in the year anyway
	* This season starts our liturgical year - so happy new year.
	* And we begin by thinking about anticipation - about the one who is to come
	* But, it's easy to wrap Advent solely into Christmas
		* When we do that, we tend to rush past it.  We already know the outcome.
		* And yeah, we retell the Holy Week with some suspension of what comes on Easter Sunday
		* But here, we have to keep in mind that there's a two-fold gaze for us - an "already-but-not-yet" stare
			* Already: yes, to the Christ child that is to come.
			* But not yet: to where Christ will return.
				* Advent helps to hear the voices of prophets who had to anticipate an indeterminant time, so we can thrive in the second.
				* The prophets always carried a hope that in the end, things would work out right - an eschatological hope.
				* And so when we start the new liturgical year, we start there - at a hope that eventually, everything will be made right.
* But every single Advent season starts with a variation of this theme.  It rightfully begs a question - this is what we're showing up for?  To hear about how bad things will be?
	* Every year, to start out, we get drawn into thinking about the world falling apart.
	* We have enough of that everywhere else, don't we?  Why bring it here?
	* To answer that question, we probably need to ask why we're here at all.
* Have you ever asked yourself that question? Why are you here?  What causes you to come to church on Sunday?
	* Pastors might be afraid to ask that question for fear of the answer being "I don't know" and folks never come back
	* We might not want to answer the question because we ourselves don't know, or our answers don't quite seem up for the effort.
* Advent on its own terms helps us to see that we're here because we are a supportive community of hope for what's coming, even if it's not here yet.
	* It's tempting for us as churches to move in two directions: we try to hide from everything going on in the world and create some kind of genteel neutrality that seems hopelessly shallow, or we spend all of our time constantly pushing against injustice, treating our faith as a Sisyphean boulder that will never reach its final destination.
	* v. 34 implores us to find a sober middle ground - don't get caught up in perpetual hangover-inducing drinking bouts, nor find yourself only buried in the worries of what's happening.
	* Jesus invites to take heart - that in the midst of difficult signs, Jesus is near.
	* This is the definition of our Christian hope - our eschatology.  That there is resolve in the end. That the world need not to be driven through in stupor or hypnotically, but engaged with hopefully.  
	* And these are not the only signs - Jeremiah, in the midst of utter and complete devastation, wrote these words as the people watched their family be carted away into slavery.
	* Jeremiah himself is in prison during a foreign invasion - but in the midst of all of that, we hear his vision of hope.
	* We hear Jesus, of course, but the people wouldn’t have heard Jesus.  But they did see the temple restored.  They were able to return home.
	* And then the temple was destroyed again - right when Luke was being written.  
* How do we live better into our Advent community?
	* Let our hearts drink a little
	* Be a little concerned about what's coming
	* And do it together.
