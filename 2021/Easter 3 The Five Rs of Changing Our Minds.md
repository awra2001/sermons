# Easter 3: The Five Rs of Changing Our Minds

SO WHAT: Rethinking concepts of repentance provides greater freedom.

First Reading **Luke 24:36b-48**
24:36b While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
24:37 They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost.
24:38 He said to them, "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
24:39 Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."
24:40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
24:41 While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
24:42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
24:43 and he took it and ate in their presence.
24:44 Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you--that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled."
24:45 Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,
24:46 and he said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,
24:47 and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
24:48 You are witnesses of these things.

Second Reading **Acts 3:12-19**
3:12 When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, "You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?
3:13 The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him.
3:14 But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,
3:15 and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
3:16 And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this pfrfect health in the presence of all of you.
3:17 "And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
3:18 In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer.
3:19 Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out,

* This American Life this week: the idea of parallel universes.
* What if that were true?  What would it change?
* Metanoia - change one's mind. 
	* This is important!  The best definitions of this word a sort of "coming to one's sense, resulting in a change of conduct."
	* We so often narrow this just into something about moral contrition, or just a simple promise to (try) to live differently.  But it seems so much more about the ability to have develop critical thinking skills and then apply them to our lives based on who Jesus Christ is - a praxis, which the Bible Study group will know is at the heart of what Acts truly is.
	* Let's walk through that today.
* 3:12-3:13 - "recognize"
	* We have this sermon here, but we aren't given the precursor of the healing of a lame beggar.  And the people of the temple thought it was amazing.
	* Peter then makes this turn to the crowd - my friends, my people, why do you think this has anything to do with what we are capable of doing?
	* And we land on the first part of metanoia - the cognitive dissonance.
		* You mean, it's not just you?  It's not just magic miracles?
		* We have to reckon with Jesus then, who Peter just takes a given. 
		* And moreover, Peter connects it to new narrative, one that connects with all of the story of his people here - if you think about early Luke and its genealogy, you see how this starts to make sense.
* 3:13-3:15 - "reconsider"
	* This previous way of doing, before what you might be struggling with now, caused something negative to occur
	* And again, most modern interpretations of repentance only spend their time here, saying that if you're bad, then you have to fix it.
	* But that denies all of the good work around this passage.
* 3:17 - "relearn"
	* You didn't know what you didn't know.
	* And here's where modern views start to come apart.  What if, every time we needed to repent, or we encouraged others to do so, we saw it as an act if ignorance?  Not knowing what to know? 
	* But, now, based on this moment, the people do know.
* 3:19 - "repent."
	* We have a moment now to be aware.  The cognitive dissonance is at hand, and so the choice is to move with a new storyline, a more accurate one, and change our actions.
	* Especially if we take repentance out of it's moral arena only, we can see how it can become an opportunity at every moment in our Christian walk to have a chance to rethink and redirect.
* 3:20-21 - "renew"
	* A better way to think of this is that the entire world is being made new because of Jesus.  Our repentance helps us to see with new vision what that is becoming.
	* And, once again, Peter connects it back to this historical narrative with the Israelites there.
* So what?
	* It's almost as if we can easily put ourselves in a position to limit the value of repentance to just when we do something "bad" morally, instead of thinking that repentance might be one of the biggest gifts of the way we were created.
	* If there's multiple universes, I'll adapt, I'll grow
