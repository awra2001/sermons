# Easter 2021: At The Crest

SO WHAT: It isn't safe, but it's good.

**Mark 16:1-8**
16:1 When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
16:3 They had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
16:4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.
16:5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
16:6 But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you."
16:8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.

* Roller Coasters
	* Say what you will about the Great Lakes Region, but one thing we do really well is roller coasters.
	* It's a rite of passage for any teenager growing up in Ohio that at some point, on your Senior trip, you'll going to Cedar Point
	* When I was graduating High School, the millenium force had hardly been open a year
		* 310 Feet tall, 2 minutes long, going 90mph at the peak
		* What's funny is to watch videos now, because you see how 30 seconds of it is just the ascent, and then rest of the time is the ride... but that's 25% is a long, slow, clanging trip.
		* You get about six seconds at the crest... and then it's right back down again.
	* It's a funny thing about the human experience that we pay money for this kind of of thing.
	* We want to safely be scared.  We want to securely be unsafe.
	* There's something about the terror and amazement that makes us feel alive.
* Huh.  Like our Easter Gospel!
	* We often take these stories about the miracles as the most exciting part of the story, but I want to offer on this Easter Sunday that all that the three years of Jesus' ministry were the chains underneath the car, driving us skyward.
	* Which would mean this Holy Week would be our crest.  And that's probably true - yes, there's some beauty here, but this it's also the most vulnerable moment of a whole roller coaster ride - one set of forces has ended and we wait for the other to take hold.  It's the last moment we second guess and wonder if what was promised is really true.
	* Now, of course, Mary, Mary, and Salome wouldn't have thought they were getting on a roller coaster, so you imagine their fear once the gravity of the moment took hold.  This easter moment was giving way to easter movement, and they were along for the ride.
		* Even the way the Greek explains this gives you the sense that they had their breaths taken away - they run away with a mix of terror (lit. shaking) and amazement (in other uses, it's related to outbursts of frenzy).
		* This is the moment you start to move down and you can't do anything else but throw your hands up in the air and scream.
		* It's also why the later-added ending never seem to make sense - it's like the later writers were more worried about justifying why the women didn't immediately go and tell everyone about what happened instead of recognizing their understandable feelings.  It's like trying to explain a roller coaster experience to someone who has never been on one.  You can't describe of feeling that kind of alive, that kind of human, to someone.  It's only experiential.
* This lands us in a complicated place.  What do we do with the millennia afterwards? What do we do with today?
	* This is the invitation of this Gospel - Jesus is already ahead of the women.  The ride is going.  It's about the experience again.
		* Physics reminds us that unless there's an extra push somewhere, we never will crest higher than our initial climb. 
		* It's hard to be on roller coasters all the time.  Any of us who have been sick afterwards understand our bodies aren't always made for that kind of experience.
		* There's been plenty of times we've been disappointed by whatever ride we've been on, and we move on.
		* However, there really is no other way to explain the ride except being on it, whether it's at the crest or coming back around to the station.  You have to experience it.
	* Maybe this Easter is an invitation to grab another ticket and get in line again.  To experience a roller coaster that brings life.
