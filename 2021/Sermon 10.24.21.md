# 10.24.21

**Jeremiah 31:7-9**
31:7 For thus says the LORD: Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, "Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel."
31:8 See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.
31:9 With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back, I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble; for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.

**Mark 10:46-52**
10:46 They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.
10:47 When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
10:48 Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
10:49 Jesus stood still and said, "Call him here." And they called the blind man, saying to him, "Take heart; get up, he is calling you."
10:50 So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.
10:51 Then Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "My teacher, let me see again."
10:52 Jesus said to him, "Go; your faith has made you well." Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.

* New Views on the Plane
	* I started the notes for today's service on a plane between Jacksonville and Pittsburgh
	* Friday was a particularly clear day, so I could see all the way down to the ground from 35k feet.
		* It was beautiful
		* Looked like stained glass with leaded roadways
		* Connected with this green-grey hues against the open waters... it was a chiaroscuro of both natural beauty and human ingenuity
		* I saw nuclear power plants that looked like pawns spread about a sprawling chess board
	* And I could go on and on about all of the flowering beauty that was there, but I also knew down there, there was someone annoyed at the traffic.  There's someone who knows they paid more for their eggs this year than they did last year and it's really frustrating.
		* After awhile when you zoom in from above and you head back down, it's not so beautiful anymore.
		* It seems mediocre, annoying, obnoxous.
	* I also wasn't unaware at the start of these notes that I was going to Ohio to see my grandmother, who I knew wasn't doing well, and in less than 12 hours would pass away.
		* When I got back on the plane, I tried as best I could to remember the beauty of the sky and the ground, and while it didn't provide comfort, it did provide me some perspective.
	* On all sides of every moments, there are heights and breadths and depths beyond our gaze
* GOSPEL
	* We don't know how long Bartimaeus was blind, but we know that he was not able to work for a living because of his condition, and had to beg
	* We also don't know what his expectations were when we shouted aloud that Jesus would have mercy.
	* But there's a ground to sky moment here in the passage - What do you want me to do for you?  Let me see.
		* And it happens!  He may not have even believed that this was going to happen, but he had the dream
		* And we see that Bart follows Jesus, but I think we should interrogate this a little bit:
			* So, what of his past?
			* What happens after Jesus is gone?
			* What life will he make for himself with his sight?
* OT
	* Here's a similar circumstance about the people of God
	* In the same way that Isa chronicles a whole story, Jer does as well
	* Returning to home wouldn't fix the past.  It doesn't repair the trauma
	* But there's something beautiful about 31:9 in particular
* DREAMS
	* Here's the gift of dreams for us: they reorient our perspective, and give us a chance to see the 35k foot view as we're sitting amidst the traffic jams
	* They don't fix now, and they certainly can't repair the past, but they help us see what can be, what should be, what could be
	* And, sometimes, they do come true.
* DEEPER
	* Deeper isn't about having dreams or not, or about believing that they come true
	* Deeper is more about allowing ourselves to see the stained-glass ground all the time
	* To cry out to Jesus when he asks what we want
