# 4/11/21: Easter 2

**John 20:19-31**
20:19 When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
20:20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
20:21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you."
20:22 When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
20:23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."
20:24 But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.
20:25 So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe."
20:26 A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
20:27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe."
20:28 Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
20:29 Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe."
20:30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
20:31 But these are written so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.

**Acts 4:32-35**
4:32 Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common.
4:33 With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
4:34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.
4:35 They laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.

* It is fascinating to me that these passages hang out together in the lectionary.
* The story of Thomas along with celebrations of Unity (Ps 133 was our call to worship today).
* I can't help but feel like it's a challenge to us - is Christian unity really a thing?  Is unity actually a thing?
	* There's all sort of good, wrap the wrist kind of sermons here.
	* Was thinking all through those, but then it's new member Sunday as well, and that's not a great way to say "welcome to the church!"
	* So, y'know, you get caught in a quandry...
* Until yesterday
	* Lindsey and the kids and I went over to my in-laws condo over on Baymeadows becuase the kids were ready to swim in the pool.
	* We hung out, I got some sun with Lindsey, and the kids jumped in.
	* And it was fun to watch them hang out with other kids and how they started playing together.
	* To them,  it was nothing terribly special - just kids playing in the pool
	* At a moment, there was a group of kids over on the other side of the pool that had new toys, and Abe and Frankie jetted over to them
	* I said to Lindsey "what is it with them playing with other kids toys?"  Lindsey reminded me "well, that's what kids do... they share their toys - they don't worry about whose is whose"
	* Sure enough, I watched every kid play with every toy - it didn't matter the age, the gender, the skin color, nothing - there were just kids playing in the pool all together.
	* And yes, there were a half a dozen parents or so, but generally, we all got to relax - occasionally steer them away from trouble - but largely we stayed out of their way.
* These kids found a way to live into Acts 4 without even knowing it.  So there is something natural here.
	* They all seemed focused on a central goal - to celebrate life by way of being in the pool.
	* And they knew, and they made sure, that they were safe.
	* And what they brought to that central goal, they shared.
	* The extent of the rules were simple - if someone needed something to play with, they played with it.  They asked one another.  Kids that hadn't known each other until that moment played on toys together.
* And honestly, I was half way to messing up the vibe.
	* I started to become a VSP - Very Serious Parent
	* I was starting to take account of the children's property, presuming the details of transactions and what was in everyone else's minds, and was ready to take action.
	* But, Lindsey stopped me - why did I need to be a VSP when there was no reason to be?  If something happened, sure - intercede.  But otherwise, let them live in their celebration!
* On a new member Sunday, we're reminded of folks who are excited to jump into the pool.
	* For us, there's an internal way of being that continues to be refined and set before us, but we also can summarize it by the idea of this being a safe haven to celebrate life.
	* The degree to which we can live into that is predicated on how often we become VSP - Very Serious Parishioners.
		* Sometimes it's needed when there are safety issues, and when the ability to celebrate life are violated, but we don't often become VSPs for those reasons.
		* Even in the gospel there's a reminder of that - forgive the sins of others and they're released, but become a VSP, and you might get caught in a cycle.
		* When someone needs something our pool, maybe we share the pool toys we brought.
		* How awesome would the church be if it was like the neighborhood pool at its best?
