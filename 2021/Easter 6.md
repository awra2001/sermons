# Easter 6

**John 15:9-17**
15:9 As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.
15:10 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
15:11 I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.
15:12 "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
15:13 No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.
15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
15:15 I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father.
15:16 You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.
15:17 I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.

SO WHAT? Love, Friendship - all these really nice things - require more than just secular niceness.

* When you've thought about the people who have called your closest friends, what has been their best qualities?
	* I really started thinking about this, and at first, I struggled to think what made the people who I thought were my closest, truest friends different than any others.
	* What seemed to separate them from others was that when the moment counted, they were frank, open, and honest about what they were thinking in our journey together.
		* The three people that came to mind that I thought were some of closest friends have been some of the people I've had some of the biggest arguments with in my life.
			* And, some of the folks who have been most generous with their praise about me and my life - acting as though they were my friends, well, I started to realize how much they truly are acting.
			* I think because of that honesty - I started to feel that I was truly loved.
		* It's also not as if that kind of honesty was always in their best interest.  I can think of times that it probably wasn't.  It would have be easier and more convenient to not speak into my life or be honest with me.  But in the end, they always chose to.
			* I found that intent wasn't just to be "honest" in order to deal with some other issue.  It wasn't an abusive type of honesty where one believes they are loved, but someone always works to undercut for other intents later.  There always seemed to be some sort of mutual understanding in it.  I wasn't being lectured, but we were learning together.
			* It also was always directed to me.  My closest friends were honest with me, and not gossiping behind me.  They've not been passive-aggressive. 
* Our passages today deal with love and friendship.  We can imagine love and friendship in some very airy, soft ways.  Jesus can become this reflection of our contemporary definition of friendship: Hangin' with the Holy One, Mimosas with the Messiah, Vacay with J... and I'm not saying that's necessarily all wrong, but certainly Jesus doesn't take the form of some kind of important savior.  At some point, you start to feel like you can ghost Jesus and Jesus can ghost you too.  That's part of modern friendship.
* Then you get to this passage here in John.  And this DEFINITELY doesn't sound contemporary at all.  And it's because it really isn't.  But we can get a sense of what the writer of the gospel is thinking about based on the time he's writing.
* The writer of the text would have been thinking about two important parts of his own culture, and showed how Jesus truly was both those things
	* There was this ideal in Aristotle's city-state that it was friendship that defined how we work together as a community.  And whether it's him or Plato or other classical philosophers, the idea of laying down one's life was the idea.  It doesn't mean it happened any more than it did now, but if you said that you were willing to give it all for someone, you were truly being a friend.
	* The other concept was open speech.  To be a friend was to not hold anything back. 
* Now, in this "farewell discourse,"  he's charging the disciples to do the same.  By extension, then, he charges us as well.
	* This helps to think anew about the rest of the gospels - when Jesus pushes back on the disciples when he washes their feet, or when he heals, or when he does anything that shows an honest pouring out of himself, "he transforms the community through his love, so that they can continue his acts of love. Love and service are defined by what Jesus has done, and what Jesus has done is share himself completely with the disciples through the symbolic act of foot washing..." healing, and a full giving of self.
* I think a reminder of what love is and isn't, and what friendship is and isn't is particularly helpful as we begin to embark on a new phase in our lives together as the church and in our community.  How can we live out the radical love of Jesus Christ as our arms and hearts open up to the greater San Marco community?
	* There is a reality that not everyone wants friendship.  Not everyone wants to live as close friends.  This is the reality of a broken world.  But to the extent that we can live that way, we're showing redemption.
	* Our vocation is one of pouring out without limits - it may not mean dying, but it may mean that we are willing as individuals and as a church to give fully.  We don't withhold who we are to someone simply because they don't like us or don't fit a mold.  We give to everyone, even those don't really seek our goodwill - just look at Jesus and Judas.
	* Our vocation is one of honest and plain speaking.
		* It's not "well I'm just bein' honest."  No one is over the other, it's not combative.  Because no one is holding anything back and there is frankness, there is vulnerability.  Being consistently honest is vulnerable. 
		* It's also not subterfuge and sabotage.  To claim to love, but then not be vulnerable and honest and work against others is at best anxiety and fear not coming our, and at worse just abusive behavior. 
		* Both of these points come out clearly in the text today.  Jesus both tells the disciples everything he knows, and isn't saying "you need to get others to lay down their lives for you benefit, and you command them as servants."  It's the opposite.
