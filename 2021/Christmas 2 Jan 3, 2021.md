# Christmas 2: Jan 3, 2021

First Reading
Jeremiah 31:7-14
31:7 For thus says the LORD: Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, and raise shouts for the chief of the nations; proclaim, give praise, and say, "Save, O LORD, your people, the remnant of Israel."
31:8 See, I am going to bring them from the land of the north, and gather them from the farthest parts of the earth, among them the blind and the lame, those with child and those in labor, together; a great company, they shall return here.
31:9 With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them back, I will let them walk by brooks of water, in a straight path in which they shall not stumble; for I have become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away; say, "He who scattered Israel will gather him, and will keep him as a shepherd a flock."
31:11 For the LORD has ransomed Jacob, and has redeemed him from hands too strong for him.
31:12 They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, and they shall be radiant over the goodness of the LORD, over the grain, the wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; their life shall become like a watered garden, and they shall never languish again.
31:13 Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old shall be merry. I will turn their mourning into joy, I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.
31:14 I will give the priests their fill of fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my bounty, says the LORD.

Second Reading
John 1:(1-9), 10-18
1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
1:2 He was in the beginning with God.
1:3 All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being
1:4 in him was life, and the life was the light of all people.
1:5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
1:7 He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.
1:8 He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.
1:9 The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.
1:10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him.
1:11 He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him.
1:12 But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God,
1:13 who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.
1:14 And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father's only son, full of grace and truth.
1:15 (John testified to him and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.'")
1:16 From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.
1:17 The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
1:18 No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father's heart, who has made him known.

* Last Sunday was like a dissonant chord. 
* It's needed, it adds color to what can seem a pedestrian piece of work, but too many, too much, it can jar us and overwhelm us.
* The trick, it seems more often than not, isn't avoiding dissonant chords, but instead good resolutions.  So I set about that task this week.
* Fragile child
	* Don't think that's changed.  This is still the fragile baby Jesus, and we still witness him as an infant. 
	* Realizing that we're not the only ones who at times have had to carry a fragile faith.  Scripture is defined in large part by people having to manage fragile faith in difficult moments.
	* Yet, there's still readings like Jeremiah's today: joyful, hopeful, and believing. 
	* How does that happen?  And not in a "bumper sticker" way, but in a way that permeates us.
	* Because a baby is still a baby, even if that baby is Jesus, and a fragile faith demands that same work.
* John
	* 1:1-9 is optional, but I'm not sure how you'd understand the rest otherwise.
	* John the author has this interesting aside here in 1:15, where John the Baptist "he who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me."
		* Grammarians might be feeling this a little, too.  I certainly did.  It's threading all of these times together as one.
		* The future changes the present because of the past. 
		* And it's a little more than that too:
			* The one who is to come, will be becoming, because he had existed (was being stronger than what we usually think of it) before me.
			* Maybe this is where that "Mary, Did You Know?" line has its most resonance - the one that you delivered will soon deliver you?  The other part of that response is "because, according to John, he existed before time with God, and so has always been part of the plan of deliverance" but that's hard to turn into good lyrics.
* The resolve to the dissonance lies in a progression that has always been planned.
	* That's the joy of this prologue - The Word was God, was with God.  Our trinitarian foundation is right here for us. 
	* And two things are here for us as well:
		* Our ability to deal with difficulties, to engage them in the church, is something we needn't be fearful of.  There's always going to be dissonance, but there will always be resolve. 
		* Fragility doesn't feel so fragile when it's part of a plan.  In fact, it may not be as fragile as it seems.  But, in its fragile state, we're invited to be more careful, more intimate, more noticing.
* Christmas joy, then, may be as much about the celebration of life in its fullness - celebration, doubt, imperfection, growth, life, death, resurrection, hope, fear, even its fragility - and knowing that it is held in promise.
* That too, may feel like more dissonance, but again, it’s not the dissonance we need fear, but a lack of any resolve.
