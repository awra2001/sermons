# Christmastide III

Jonah 3:1-5, 10
3:1 The word of the LORD came to Jonah a second time, saying,
3:2 "Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you."
3:3 So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days' walk across.
3:4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's walk. And he cried out, "Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
3:5 And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.
3:10 When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.

Psalm 62:5-12
62:5 For God alone my soul waits in silence, for my hope is from him.
62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
62:7 On God rests my deliverance and my honor; my mighty rock, my refuge is in God.
62:8 Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us.
62:9 Those of low estate are but a breath, those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.
62:10 Put no confidence in extortion, and set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
62:11 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,
62:12 and steadfast love belongs to you, O Lord. For you repay to all according to their work.

Mark 1:14-20
1:14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God,
1:15 and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news."
1:16 As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea--for they were fishermen.
1:17 And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fish for people."
1:18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
1:19 As he went a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.
1:20 Immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.

* We're building on a theme these next few weeks of rethinking our intentions in the work that we do.
* We seek the welfare of the nation, the community, etc. 
* Last week, Ana did a terrific job opening up the first part of this by reminding us that God has made us good.  We're created and capable for this calling.
* But what if we're not so convinced about the task?
	* This is where Jonah is today.
		* Jonah obviously himself is a capable prophet, created for a calling to serve the people... but it's a different people.
		* We know the story, of course - he tries to run away, and is swallowed up, realizes his folly, and then is asked to again.
		* And, now, he's back on his path, headed towards Nineveh, which truly was a huge city for its time, and a seat of incredible power.
		* Jonah does what he's asked, and wouldn't you know it - it worked!
		* The rest of the story just as interesting.  Jonah's mad it worked!  He lets God know about it, and God responds ultimately by saying "shouldn't I care about 120,000 people who can't tell their right from their left and their animals?"
		* If we place this within the context of our last couple weeks, we can argue that God cares about those who don't know, and has mercy on those who don't understand.  Unconditional love!
		* Where God places his call for righteousness, then, is on those who have been gifted and called.
	* The Psalm is both comfort and caution for the called.
		* Yes, God is steadfastly loving
		* Yes, we can trust God
		* However, God's will does win out.  The power does belong to God
		* And God's will is for the welfare of those who are still learning and trying.
		* And, it bears notice in the Psalm that it really doesn't even matter one's position in life - poor, rich, weak, strong - all of that is a rounding error when compared to God.
* As we think about the true welfare of the city, then, part of it is recognizing we're up for the task, but another part is that God is too.
	* It means showing unconditional love to folks we're unconvinced need to receive it.  And that we work towards the welfare of those people who will receive God's unconditional love.
	* It's why the signs that were up for a long time in our neighborhood are wonderful - love everyone, always.  But it will always have to go one step further than a yard sign.  It's having to go to the places we don't want with the people we don't care for to give them what we don't care to give.  God is going to be there anyway. 
		* We have a unique situation at S Jax, for instance, that we have two census tracts that have an 8x difference in annual household income - $183,041 vs. $22,223.
		* The instinct may be that the rich folks need to give to the poor folks - and that's in part true.
		* But the rich folks need something, too.  And it may be the poor folks who can give it to them.  In the end, it truly is rounding errors.  What we must do is go and seek their welfare, and go both places, even if we wonder why we would.
		* Next week we'll talk more about what that would look like.
