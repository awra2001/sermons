# Easter 4

* In the Acts passage, we have a similar refrain about who Jesus is.
* Might be worth it instead to tend to the attributes of this Jesus who now twice we're invited to know and to change our minds about.
* This week we get to see Jesus as the Good Shepherd.
* The good shepherd is one who chooses the sheep and knows them.
* **Chooses The Sheep**
	* Jesus mentions that he lays his life down for his sheep.
		* But that isn't the whole story - he makes this choose fully on his own.
		* 10:17 - lit. tithemi - same root where we get tithe - Jesus is making an offering of himself by choice.
		* But then he takes it up again.  And life here is more than just the physical breathing, but it's meant to think about our souls - our whole lives.
	* In choosing the sheep, Jesus gives his whole self to the flock, and in doing so, gains his life.
	* Contrast that to the hired worker - I think about the person in a movie that as disaster comes throws their hands up in the air and says "I don't get paid enough for this" and runs away. 
		* It's clear that hired hand is in it for themselves - for their pay, for the minimum about of work for the maximum return.
		* That doesn't lead to the safety of the flock though - in the end, all it does is show who's willing to stick in when times get tough.
* **Knows The Sheep**
	* The word that Jesus uses here to describe "knowing" the sheep isn't an academic knowledge, but instead is one known through experience.
	* Reminds us of the Psalm 23 shepherd that we heard a little today - that shepherd is beside the flock, guiding and leading.
	* It means that Jesus isn't looking at the flock in abstraction, but instead living with them, is aware of their needs.  This is a knowledge of journeying together.
	* And Jesus says, he's aware of other flocks - he has journeyed with others too.  This is an inclusive shepherd.
* So what?
	* Two ways to think about it - internal and external
	* External
		* We as a church are the shepherd of the places where we find ourselves - our pastures.
		* In the greater San Marco area, we are called to choose and know, and serve the other flocks, not just the one that looks like ours.
		* When things get hard here - whether it's the anger of a Right Size or the pain of prostitution and drug use that runs Phillips Highway, we have to say we're here.  As much as we're capable, we say we're journey with everyone around us. 
		* SJPC needs to offer itself fully - its very life - in order to take it up again.  It's a hard thing to do! 
	* Internal
		* It might be equally as hard to commit to be a good shepherd internally.
		* This does have it's different levels, I suppose - I am called a "pastor," and I act as shepherd.  There should be some expectation that I'm journeying with you, I'm willing to give of myself to serve well here. 
		* But if we call ourselves "ministers," as we like to here, then it comes with some responsibilities.  It means that we're not acting like a hired hand that when things get tough we run away. 
			* Don't hear that as minimizing the truth that sometimes we need to be sheep.  We want to be provided for, we want to be cared for (PS 23).
			* But what none of this presumes is that when the tough times come, we throw our hands in disgust and walk away.  There's no safety there.  No security.
			* In fact, it may be that moment that we work hardest - we care for the flock more.
