# Christmastide I - Jan 10, 2021

First Reading Jeremiah 29:1-9
29 These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles, and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 2 This was after King Jeconiah, and the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem. 3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. It said: 4 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5 Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. 7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. 8 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let the prophets and the diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream, 9 for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, says the Lord.

Second Reading Mark 6:7-13
7 He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. 8 He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; 9 but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics. 10 He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. 11 If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” 12 So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent. 13 They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.

* On Wednesday at 6pm or so, I imagine, if you listened really carefully, you heard the echo of ripped paper rippling throughout the US.  That was the collective tearing of sermons everyone as folks who are charged with both explaining the good news of Scripture and the world together realized that they had to speak into what happened.
* We turned to what we know in the immediate moments as we all watched Wednesday - we tried to reach out to you, we sought God in prayer, we turned to our colleagues, and then we turned back to a reworking of our texts.
	* And let's just be clear here - no one who is trying to help others make sense is a good and faithful servant.
	* But, perhaps we've become a bit cliche, as this bingo board might indicate.
	* And it's not that any of those things are wrong, necessarily, but within context, they seem to fall flat.
	* Because we've had to do these so many times, too, I wonder if we all fall into a pattern.
		* We as clergy try to push one direction or the other - the bingo card, or maybe we try to be more prophetic, and we wait for your response
		* Some folks won't say anything some folks will be delighted, and some folks will get angry.
		* And then we'll move on.  It's exhaustion, it's not knowing what to do, it's the need to only go so far.
		* Aren't you tired of that?  That the church could become so predictable and cliche that we can be turned into a meme? 
		* How do we break this pattern?  Wake ourselves up?
* To get at breaking a pattern, we have to get to the root.  And it may be how we see ourselves in the first place.
* Jer
	* This is Jeremiah reaching out to the people who have been taken away from their homes - every right to be mad, to reject Babylon
	* But, instead, Jer is suggesting that they should be productive where they are.
		* For those who remain, there also might be a benefit for them too - for as Babylon goes, so do they.
		* Their time should not just be negative, but instead positive.
			* They can live, eat, grow as a people.
		* But, also it might require their effort. 
		* And all of it has intention - it's not just for them, but it's for all.  And you'd imagine that Jer is not putting a timeline on it - for as long as they're in Babylon, they ought to seek the welfare of the city.  The previous chapter was Jer pushing back against the thought that this exile would be limited to two years - and Jer wasn't having it.  It could be awhile, so you may as well work for the best of all, including yourself.
	* If Jer invites exiles to do this - what is it for us who aren't exiles?
		* What happened on Wednesday is us.  What happened this summer is us.  We delude ourselves is we think that this isn't part of who we are, and it invites to presume we're simply exiles waiting for ticket out.
		* Even if it **wasn't** us, says it doesn't matter.  We ought to be aware we're here for awhile, and we should dig in.
* Struck by Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse - tell the truth to people, and in the midst of ugliness, speak of beauty.
	* This is where the cliches start to receive their judgement: Sure, we can go to our prayer closets.  But the door should be swung wide open so we can witness what is happen and pray for it to be better.  Anyone who has been forced to be in a closed closet of any time will tell you its suffocating, even if it feels momentary safer.  It may not be safe at all. MLK was right, but not to soothe our consciences. 
	* So let's just call this what is - what happened on Wednesday was not in anyway for the benefit of any of us.  Built on the very most generous take a series of exaggerated half-truths, people sought violence against the country's leaders.  I don't agree with everyone on Capitol Hill, but this is not welfare.  This is evil, propagated the people you saw on the stage Wednesday morning and on down - yes, including Donald Trump.
	* But to leave it there lets all of us sit and stew - live into the ugliness.
	* Instead, what if we seek the welfare of this nation?
		* What if we _actually_ worked for it? We built homes, planted gardens, we grew?  What if we weren't just a meme?
		* What if we didn't listen to "prophets" who want to tell us that it isn't our task?  Call it a lie!  Shake the dust off.
* So how?
	* It's a much about doing what we always do, but having different intention.
	* A believers, Wednesday should be a call to action.  To learn for different reasons, to speak for different reasons, to do all that we do for different reasons. 
	* Boy, doesn't that sound a lot like the Kingdom coming? 
	* This Sunday begins a series on this - how DO we do this?  What are the big pieces.
