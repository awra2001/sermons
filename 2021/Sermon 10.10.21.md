# 10.10.21

First Reading **Amos 5:6-7, 10-15** 
5:6 Seek the LORD and live, or he will break out against the house of Joseph like fire, and it will devour Bethel, with no one to quench it. 
5:7 Ah, you that turn justice to wormwood, and bring righteousness to the ground! 
5:10 They hate the one who reproves in the gate, and they abhor the one who speaks the truth. 
5:11 Therefore because you trample on the poor and take from them levies of grain, you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not live in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine. 
5:12 For I know how many are your transgressions, and how great are your sins-- you who afflict the righteous, who take a bribe, and push aside the needy in the gate. 
5:13 Therefore the prudent will keep silent \[or, moan and mourn\] in such a time; for it is an evil time. 
5:14 Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, just as you have said. 
5:15 Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. 

Second Reading **Mark 10:17-31** 
10:17 As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
10:18 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. 
10:19 You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.'" 
10:20 He said to him, "Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth." 
10:21 Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, "You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me." 
10:22 When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions. 
10:23 Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!" 
10:24 And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 
10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." 
10:26 They were greatly astounded and said to one another, "Then who can be saved?" 
10:27 Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible." 
10:28 Peter began to say to him, "Look, we have left everything and followed you." 
10:29 Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, 
10:30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age--houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields with persecutions--and in the age to come eternal life. 
10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first. 

* Did y'all see that Estate Sale down the street?
	* Lindsey told me about it on Friday, and I was a little unsure about going
	* But we drove past and even the security guard said to go.
	* Later we found out it was the Winn-Dixie house, but some of the things for sale were spectacular
	* It makes you wonder how one gets to that point where they collect like that.
	* But you notice, of course, that there are other things that aren't as glamorous - "best friends" coffee cups, ab rollers, etc
	* In the midst of that expense, it still wasn't hard to see someone more than just the things - someone who shuffled out the bedroom, someone concerned about their midsection. 
	* So often, it's easy to forget that underneath it all, we're still just people. 
* The man was excited.
	* He finally had his chance to see Jesus
	* We don’t know his story, but we imagine he’s been successful
		* He had things, he had means
		* He also had been religious, growing up in the faith of his ancestors
		* He did what he was supposed to do, and if the world had rewarded him for it, so much the better.
	* And when he finally did it, finally saw Jesus, he fell to his knees.
	* And he called him good!
		* So rare for rabbis to be called good
		* But the man knew how special this Jesus was.
	* When he heard Jesus’ first response, we can imagine his relief.  His confidence.  His relief.
	* And then Jesus looked, and he loved him - this really _was_ a good man.  This was someone Jesus valued, and wasn’t looking to denounce hypocrisy.  
* This is love?
	* You know, you do the right thing all your life and this is what you get - the request for the one last thing, the impossible thing.
	* The Message: "The man’s face clouded over. This was the last thing he expected to hear, and he walked off with a heavy heart. He was holding on tight to a lot of things, and not about to let go."  Eugene H. Peterson, _The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language_ (Colorado Springs, CO: NavPress, 2005), Mk 10:22
	* Our temptation here might be to try to soften this blow - that maybe there was something else here, but instead, Jesus decides to double-down on his disciples - it’s not just this one guy where there can be a struggle, but it can be so many others.
		* Obviously this might shock some of the disciples
		* And while we weren’t there so we don’t know exactly how Peter responds here, I think it’s possible that we can relate to his comment in Mark:
			* One of smugness - that yeah, we did better than that rich person… we gave up our boats, look at us.  We’re gonna be the ones to get into heaven.
			* One of frustration - Jesus, really, we’ve given it all.  What more do you want from us?
	* This passage gives us permission to acknowledge the difficulty of this journey - our time here on earth is not entirely straightforward, and there are choice we need to make.  They’re not just the moral “right and wrong” but they extend into the very way we set our lives together.
	* But Jesus asks us that if we want to go deeper, we're willing to give up those things that separate us - our comforts, our invulnerabilities.  
		* The interesting aspect of being on the river or ocean... the further you go away, the more people you have around you - the more vulnerable and uncomfortable you might be, and when you look at the space in between the two, it kinda shows.
* Example: Amos
	* Amos’ main criticism in prophesy was against the northern tribes and their comfort.
		* This was at a time when both kingdoms were at the zenith of their power
		* Lots of people who could lounge 
		* It’s caused them, according to Amos, to “push aside the needy at the gate”
		* The gate is the place where economic and legal actions were done
* What Jesus gives us that Amos doesn't, however, is the opportunity to walk away.
	* Going deeper isn't coercive, nor is it mandatory.
	* Like last week and contractual obligations, we could move through our lives solely in "good, clean livin'" with all the of the accoutrements that demonstrate that livin'.
	* Even Jesus acknowledges that it's hard.
* But the question may be less about how far we go, and if we're willing to try at all
	* Are there things we're willing to strip out all of the things that hide our shuffling and exercise anxieties and meet others.
	* Walking this path isn't without its consequence: we aren't doing or being the same.
	* Going deeper doesn't mean going from the last to first.  It may mean getting closer than what we were.
