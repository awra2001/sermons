# Easter 5

* At the end of March, Gallup came out with a survey that said for the first time, US Church membership fell below the majority.
	* This is down from 70 percent at the turn of the century.
	* However, the same survey notes that in spite of this decline, 70% of people are still affiliated with some type of organized religion.  So there's still people seeking after God, but maybe not in the ways we have done traditionally.
	* There's often questions when these surveys come up.  Wondering about millennials, wondering about COVID, wondering about the death of the church.
* In my mind, they all come down to spreading the Good News - evangelism.
	* It can be a little bit of a difficult, because us as mainliners, the idea of being "evangelical" brings up bad vibes.
		* Maybe we came out of that tradition, and we want to stay away.
		* Maybe it's a way of doing church that is unenjoyable.
	* Sometimes, it's just because we don't know a good way to do it.  Luckily, this moment in Acts helps us.
* The work of Evangelism...
	* Is not of our own accord
		* It is God's task
			* First, the angel of the Lord says to Philip
			* Then the Holy Spirit directs Philip to the chariot
			* Perhaps more than anything, it's our task to just simply be present and listen.  Pay attention.  It means being out on the road first, too.
		* It's the other's invitation
			* Do you notice that while Philip asks a simple question of comprehension, he takes the lead of the eunuch?
			* No forcing to be there, or forcing to be baptized.  Philip was ready always, but
			* Again, if we're present, and we listen, someone may want to know what we think.
		* Which means it's on someone else's timetable
			* Being present and listening may mean it happens when we don't expect.
			* In this case, it's in a chariot
			* We might get lucky and someone wanders in on Sunday, but more than likely, the work of telling this story happens at a bar on a Wednesday, a concert on a Saturday, or in the bank line on a Tuesday.
	* Is about going to others on equal terms
		* So much effort in scholarship has been made about who this eunuch is
			* Is he Jewish or Gentile, or a transitional figure?
			* Being a eunuch makes him a transitional figure as well in antiquity - not quite a man, not quite not a man.
			* Is Candace a formal name or a title?
			* Ethiopian in the Greek literally means "burnt face," so we know he's darker skinned than Philip
			* Because of this, we're apt to want to gawk a little. 
			* But the writer here doesn't give us enough.  All that we know is that he's different than Philip.  That's enough
			* Maybe it's becuase it matters enough that he's different, but not enough to believe that it has any difference on the need to hear the story of Jesus Christ
			* This is where we can play evangelical hot hands with folks.  It's no wonder people shy away then.
		* This also extends to his position in life
			* He's wealthy, and he has power
			* In this case, it doesn't matter a whole lot.
	* Is about telling the story of life
		* This, of course, means knowing these stories well enough that we can express them.  That we feel okay with saying "do you understand this?"
		* But remember that knowing is so multifaceted.  Comprehension is deeper than reading.  It involves our whole selves that we bring to the text. 
		* So, yes, it's a plug to take some time out to go to Sunday School, and I'm still working on making accessible online so you can study anytime. 
		* But it's also your story, too.  Who are you?
* In the end, this goes way beyond membership or growing churches.  It's not transactional.  It's relational, but with the other and with God.  We trust the time we have and we do what we're supposed to do.
