<p>Whether we want it to or not, our weekly rituals in worship can become rote - we sing the Doxology, we read similar prayers of confession, and perhaps one of the most ubiquitous, we recite the Lord's Prayer over and over again.&nbsp; Often times, too, the Prayer is recited towards the end of a service, so our minds understandably begin to move from the worship space to the narthex and out the door for our next activities.<br><br>Recently, the Lectionary text Gospel reading was from Luke 11, including another form of the Lord's Prayer that's slightly different than the one we tend to recite from Matthew.&nbsp; I decided to translate the passage directly from the Greek as part of my preparation for that Sunday as a way to open up something that seems so familar.<br><br>What struck me more than anything else was the use of the "Imperative" in the text.&nbsp; For those of you who may have pushed Grammar lessons out of your mind, the imperative is a command - things that we request from others.&nbsp; Throughout the prayer, we are encouraged to request from God to&nbsp;δίδου - Give!, or&nbsp;ἄφες - forgive! us.&nbsp; Jesus is not instructing us to blithely hope for something to come that may or may not, but instead instructs us to have a deep and abiding expectation of being given what we need, including forgiveness.<br><br>Just as interesting are the words we translate as "give us this day our daily bread."&nbsp; Many of these words are in what's called the Accusative, which help us to describe the limits of the verb, in this case "give".&nbsp; Jesus is making it clear that God will give (and again, we expect it and request it!) but daily, only daily.<br><br>In a world of 401(k)s and five year strategic planning, the idea of only daily supply is uncomfortable.&nbsp; Yet if we truly believe what Jesus speaks here, then what each of us has is an expectation of a God who is forever caring for each of us in the present moment.&nbsp; Just like the Israelites wandering in the desert, we are given our manna, but portioned out one day at a time.<br><br>Every week, then, hidden in plain sight in the Lord's Prayer, is a continued promise of fulfillment, God saying "yes, my child, I will satisfy your needs - no more and no less than what you need, each and every day.&nbsp; Just simply ask."<br><br>Do you believe that?&nbsp; Some days I know I struggle to think that I am taken care of, and if I'm honest I wish I had a little bit more of a backup than just one day.&nbsp; Often, I think it's because I struggle to believe that I'll wake up tomorrow and there will be the same "enough" as today.<br><br>That's the struggle of faith.&nbsp; In the end, Jesus teaches us about faith in the Lord's Prayer, and what we demand from the Lord's Prayer is faith, just enough to make it through the day.<br><br>I encourage you as we start heading into the new-old busyness that fall lends us to really live into that daily faith.&nbsp; In the end, it is what we survive on.</p>
