![[Year A Proper 26#Micah 3 5-12]]
![[Year A Proper 26#Matthew 23 1-12]]

It’s funny how the spirit works.  Given the realities of the last few weeks, I’ve realized I’m due for some time off.  I’m worn and tired and have learned more than once that by not taking time to rest and reflect, I become useless to anyone – God, this church, my friends, or my family.  We together have the opportunity later today to vote and celebrate the labor of the Nominating Committee as we welcome new elders and trustees to serve at SJPC, and for a couple, they continue their service.

Yet, for all of us, we are met with these passages today in the lectionary.  On the surface, they are challenging, demanding texts.  We hear prophetic words through Jesus and Micah, stark and controversial.  They don’t leave much quarter for those of us who carry the responsibility of the ordination vows we take – elders all, once and forever. 

It’d be tempting to skip them and gloss over them as an ecumenical mistake – we don’t need these, do we?  And, personally, it’s not an enjoyable activity when I feel gears grinding against gears already to try to delve into a text that implicates not just me but all of us.  I prefer to leave for two weeks with a pleasant thought in all our hearts! 

But yet, let’s trust the Spirit’s call and the hope of good news as we begin.

Sometimes, in moments like these, we begin with the end in mind, and here, we have a picture Jesus paints for us: a world of joyful equals under one authority – that of God.  A siblinghood of believers.  For those of us who take on the call to be elders – pastors, leaders – we put on the stripped robes of servanthood: our commitment to look as Jesus does on Maundy Thursday, washing the feet of those around us whom we’re called to guide.  When we discern, we do so as servants.  When we guide, we do so as caretakers.

It's why, at times, how we design our churches can be confusing.  We see the pulpit and lectern elevated.  Should we take that too literally or with little thought, we can imagine that they’re meant to be indications of the person seated in them – and indeed, in many of our experiences, we have witnessed the pastor who lives into a narrative that they are higher than those in the pews.

I’m constantly reminded, however, that in the end, as clergy, our task is no more than to be one of the many set aside by our collective community for a particular call.  When I went through becoming a pastor in the PCUSA, I remembered that the rigors our denomination put forth were meant to be a time of refinement: I took time to learn so that I could help others do the same.  Fundamentally, the task is custodial – we as clergy sweep the floors of our souls, remove the cobwebs that settle in our hearts, and labor in the hopes that we shine as brightly as we first believed.  But, even from this vaunted pulpit, I find my heart with you, in a pew, looking up towards a God who we are all trying to follow in a world we want to make sense of with more clarity.  The one in front of the journey of faith is no more gifted than the one in the rear – they have learned to read the terrain more clearly.

This is also why, as a pastor, I love how our polity is structured because it is a continued reminder of that reality.  It’s why we started calling pastors teaching elders in contrast to ruling elders and no longer Ministers of Word and Sacrament.  While it certainly confused people, it reminds us of an important point: when we all gather to be ordained or installed in our congregations, we’re asked nine questions.  Eight are the same – only one changes based on the role.  In that way, the pastor amongst Session – the moderator of the board – is at best first amongst equals, looking to maintain order and fidelity to the promises we’ve all sworn to God and our church.  And when we do so, we are reminded of Christ’s words as he lambastes leaders – we are compelled to live what we promise and teach.  This is the prophet’s candor and honesty: the title of elder is wasted without the action to live it well. 

And goodness, we are all guilty of forgetting that occasionally.  We can claim superiority through experience, through a title, through time – we use the long fringes and the chairs of authority to tear one another down.  Verse four is challenging to hear in this light, and each of us in leadership does well to remember: in our desire to lead, do we over-burden each other, lay the responsibilities of doing the servant's work on someone else while avoiding the task on our own?  Do we work out our own brokenness – our own custodial activities and repair at someone else's expense? 

Think about it this way – when was the last time you were upset about something happening in a church?  Did you take a moment to reflect on if it is the Spirit’s continued prophetic nudge in your own heart, or did you deflect it with a “well, it’s that person’s fault, not mine”: the elder, the pastor, the congregant?  Gratefully, in part, the lectionary skips the next part of Jesus’s screed against the leaders of his day in the seven woes.  Still, a peak into them will tell you what’s at stake: it’s the locking of others out of the kingdom of heaven – the hope of an equal community of believers together walking, looking up at God again, seeking wisdom and discernment there, and not from just ourselves.

This idea is doubly enforced by Micah’s prophetic word as well.  I loved, in particular, Carolyn Sharp’s commentary on the matter:

“Believers dare not take the prophetic word for granted.  Hearing that word is never easy, though, because it holds us and our communities accountable.  We would much rather hear words of “shalom.” Imagine a false prophet offering the annual report for your congregation:

·     Certainly our church is doing all it can for the poor!

·     Naturally, we strive to act with compassion in every aspect of our lives!

·     Of course we give sacrificially to bring near the kingdom of God, rather than hoarding our wealth!

·     God has nothing but fabulous blessings in store for us. Good work, everyone!

But our incarnational God knows the truth of our lives. We fall short daily, and we must repent if we are to be in honest relationship with God and one another. Therefore, God stirs up prophets to speak the truth to us–not to condemn us, but to invite us into more authentic discipleship and deeper love for others.”

And here again, in these thorny texts, we find the good news – while our hearts may behoove us to do otherwise, there is always a chance to be invited into better discipleship and more profound love.  To cast aside all else is to feel Micah’s heart when he states he is full of the power of God to do justice.  To not find the specks in other’s eyes but to offer God our planks.  To change our minds in the work of leadership to be servants first.  In a world of equal footing that works all ways: from leader to congregation, clergy to leader, leader to church.  If we start there, might our ears be more tuned to hear God’s call for deeper engagement? 

As I walk away from SJPC for a couple of weeks, I find this to be a centering prayer for me and all of us.  How may I need to repent – where are there places I need to change my mind?  How might the Spirit nudge some of you currently serving?  How might the Spirit prepare some of you to serve in the coming years?

This all might trigger our cynical hearts.  We may hear all of this and wonder if it’s a ploy of a tired pastor to urge people to play nice in the sandbox for a little bit.  Or, it might feel like all of this is an invitation to turn tail and run – some of y’all who will be voted on today haven’t even started yet, so you have a chance to go away.  Why start here?  Why offer this challenge from the texts today? 

Ultimately, I don’t see this as a dour task, one of failure – no more than I see stained walls adorning our sanctuary from leaks as an indication of a collapsing building.  On the contrary – what I see in both is a chance for renewal – a chance for each of us to spot a place that needs some repair that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. 

Nor is it about conduct or care as an end unto itself.  Instead, it’s an opportunity for deeper discipleship.  And just as the master craftsman has been about the task these last couple weeks of applying care to our windows and gutters, so does the architect of the Creation have the skills to ply a Master’s craft on each of us.  And there, in that action, we begin the servant’s work.  When we cry out as leaders, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me,” we perform the custodial work we want others to do.  We ask no more burden than we undertake.  And what equality – what hope! – might a church active in that work become?  What prophetic story is told?

So, friends, as we continue, let us be unafraid of the challenge laid before us today.  Let’s become the community Christ calls us to.  Let’s love more deeply, starting with ourselves.  Let’s be a holy community of unburdened equals.  TBTG.
