# Palm Sunday 04.02.23

* Palm Sunday marks one of the most visible, dramatic displays of how Jesus' ministry had impacted the region.
* But as we begin, it looks very different.  In fact, the majority of this story today reads more like a logistics meeting with a vendor.
	* Jesus needs some transportation, and he delegates the responsibility to two disciples.
	* And they're not looking for just anything, but a unique thing - a donkey tied with a colt.
	* Here in Matthew, we get to understand the reason why - to satisfy what had been promised way back in Zechariah: that the one who would lead them would come humbly on donkey and colt.
* You'd imagine that for something so important, so critical as the triumphant entry into Jerusalem, there would be a little bit more debate or concern.  Not at the very least, some more foresight into the matter.  This proves Jesus is the King.  It proves Jesus is the leader that was promised.
* Yet it all hinges on two disciples, and somewhere, two lowly animals.
	* Far as we can tell, there is no plan B
	* Jesus isn't going either - it's just the two going out ahead.
	* And, it depends on identifying these specific animals in this specific configuration.
* I wonder how often we consider how much of the forthcoming of God's commonwealth - the place where Jesus is celebrated as the humble king - is entrusted to us to make happen.
	* For our confirmands today, this is a good word to hear - we talked about this a lot during our classes.  As they transition into full membership today, we acknowledge that they have all the rights, responsibilities, and benefits of that membership - they can lead in whatever ways they are called to as part of SJPC.  And getting to know them, they have a myriad of amazing gifts that will help show who Jesus is in the world.
	* As a community, it might be hard to entrust the decisions of our community to youth - the decisions seem to weighty, too serious.
	* And, goodness, we can feel the same about ourselves.  Too often, we stop ourselves from doing the work of ministry that brings us joy because we wonder if we're capable, if what we're tasked with will achieve anything.  How will this thing that helps me become the thing I know I've been called to ever achieve what Jesus is calling us toward?
* In these moments, we might want to imagine Jesus just about a half a mile outside of the gates of Jerusalem.  There, he knows the task ahead.  He knows what he's been called to do, to show, to become.  And he entrusted the important task of facilitation to his disciples - to you, to our confirmands.  There is no other option, no other way.  Jesus trusts his disciples enough to rest everything on them completing the task.  And they do!
* As we continue on our journey - of the extravagant, beautiful miracles that show who Jesus is, and allow them to celebrate his majestic presence in the world, let us be believed in.  Let us go do the work, knowing its importance but also the weighty about of trust we've been given.  Let us go unafraid.
