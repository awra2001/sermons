# Sermon
- This weekend there was an article from the NYT that was a coda to a series about the changing landscape of organized religion.
- It noted that for many of the youngest adults, their primary reason for no longer being a part of faith communities is "formative distrust".  This showed in polling: the majority of people that were either Gen X or older believed that their leaders could be trusted, but when Millennials and Gen Z were asked the same, that number dropped to about a third.
- This has a direct effect on how people perceive faith leaders.  Note this quote:
>When I talked to several readers under 30 about moving away from the faith traditions they were brought up in, more than one used the metaphor of a ==Jenga tower: When they lost faith in the religion they were raised in, it was as if load-bearing blocks were being removed and eventually the entire structure collapsed.==

- This is a landscape that can provide a study like Reign of Christ or Christ the King a little more challenging.  We already struggle with the idea of a king in a democracy like ours, and when you couple that with failing trust in leaders already, it seems like a recipe for dismissal.  Why should any of us be convinced that Jesus is worth trusting? 
- Our text today in Matthew doesn't help us at first - we have this visage of Christ on a throne, separating not just people but nations.  But where it turns is in the question that Jesus offers - where did we see you?  How did we know you?  His response: when you took care of the "least of these"
- This idea - of a king being enfleshed in the least of these - is an idea that is relegated to fairy tales.  We love the idea, and we might tell it to our children as myth, hoping that they glean knowledge and perhaps live a better life: a load bearing block in our faith journey.  Yet, when we don't take it as a reality - as a gospel truth - then when we do otherwise, we bear the consequence of pulling that block from underneath others.
- Take, for instance, another quote from the NYT article.  
>Jadon George, 20, who lives in Philadelphia, said there were many moments that caused him to question the Christianity he was raised with, but the final straw was the [sexual assault accusations](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/ravi-zacharias-sexual-abuse.html) against Ravi Zacharias, a now deceased evangelist whom his family used to listen to on the radio. “He knew how to hold an audience in the palm of his hand,” George told me.
> Zacharias cautioned male leaders not to be alone with women: “I have long made it my practice not to be alone with a woman other than Margie and our daughters — not in a car, a restaurant or anywhere else,” [he reportedly said](https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/september/ravi-zacharias-sexual-harassment-rzim-spa-massage-investiga.html). But several women alleged that in private he wasn’t just alone with them, he harassed and assaulted them. It particularly bothered George that [a witness told independent investigators](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zacharias-report.pdf) that Zacharias said she shouldn’t speak out against him, ==“or she would be responsible for the ‘millions of souls’ whose salvation would be lost if his reputation was damaged.”==
- Never mind the fact that somehow Zacharaias presumed that somehow, he had the authority of the King in Matthew here, and could somehow have had the power to separate sheep from goats.  Still, it would seem that the "least of these" commands was left to a fantasy - certainly, we don't see Mr. Zacharias enfleshed in the people who would rather be left on the margins.  And so, sadly and predictably, our friend Jadon struggles to trust.
- So what should we do then?  How might we help others trust in this Christ?  How do we trust in Christ ourselves?  What's the good news here?
- When I was in graduate school, I found at times, I'd get to a point where I'd feel exhausted and sad.  Any of you who have gone through that gauntlet know how the walls start to close in on you as you write, see the same people every day, and feel that you're never going to get done.
- When I felt that way, I'd call my mom, whose recommendation would be to serve.  Go to a shelter of some type.  Take care of some animals somewhere.
- What was always striking about that is that she never offered recourse to the bigger picture issue - she never invited me to change the system or to unravel the injustices at hand.  Instead, it was to show up and take care of people.
- That is also striking in the text - we're not asked to work towards the systemic problems.  There is no "take the time to systemically undercut why these least of these are the least of these in the first place," but instead, "just go care.  Go feed, go quench thirst, go clothe."
- So, maybe the answer falls somewhere in getting to know the King.  If I go out to care, feed, and quench thirst, I'm meeting Jesus again.  This same Christ who will make the judgments of the nations is in the homeless person looking for a meal, the family at the shelter.  The King is both on and off the throne - away, but so near.
- That doesn't mean justice isn't done.  Ezekiel reminds us that God will step in as shepherd and feed the people with justice.  In a world full of people who find their needs unsupplied, God will feed the people with what will make things right again.
- What an amazing web this creates for us, then!
	- When we feel our trust waning or when we try to demonstrate why others should trust this Christ, we should go off and serve.  There, we meet the enfleshed King hidden away.  
	- As that happens, not only do we not lose a load-bearing block, but we also add new blocks.  We establish strength with those we serve as we meet Christ, and we also strengthen the bonds with the community of servants as well.
	- But also, we offer those "least of these" a chance to be fed, even briefly, the justice God brings.  There are people who will take the time to be there, to love, to feed, to clothe.
	- There are tiny moments to collect the currency of grace as Michael talked about last week.  These sustain us.
