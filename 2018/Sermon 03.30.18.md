### Isa 25:6-9; Ps 118:1-2, 14-24; I Cor 15:1-11; Mark 16:1-8

#### **Isaiah 25:6-9**
25:6 On this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food filled with marrow, of well-aged wines strained clear.
25:7 And he will destroy on this mountain the shroud that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever.
25:8 Then the Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the LORD has spoken.
25:9 It will be said on that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so that he might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

#### **Psalm 118:1-2, 14-24**
118:1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his steadfast love endures forever!
118:2 Let Israel say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
118:14 The LORD is my strength and my might; he has become my salvation.
118:15 There are glad songs of victory in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD does valiantly;
118:16 the right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD does valiantly."
118:17 I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD.
118:18 The LORD has punished me severely, but he did not give me over to death.
118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD.
118:20 This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.
118:21 I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation.
118:22 The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.
118:23 This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.
118:24 This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.

####**1 Corinthians 15:1-11**
15:1 Now I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand,
15:2 through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you--unless you have come to believe in vain.
15:3 For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures,
15:4 and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures,
15:5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
15:6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.
15:7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
15:8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them--though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
15:11 Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come to believe.

####**Mark 16:1-8**
16:1 When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
16:3 They had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
16:4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.
16:5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
16:6 But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you."
16:8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.

Do you all have your calendars handy? I know some of you probably use your phones, or maybe some of you are still holding out and using a paper calendar.  If you have it, take it out.  What’s on it?  Probably more than a few appointments - points in time where we have a sense something will happen.  You put the doctor on your calendar with the expectation that the doctor will see you.  Unless he or she tells you otherwise, you expect that your friend is going to meet you for dinner.

Maybe you had today on the calendar.  Lots of folks do.  This might be one of the times that you’re certain to come to church because you know there’s something significant about today.  This is a moment above lots of others in our church year.  Here, on this day, we gather to celebrate Christ’s resurrection over death - and we are invited into that new life!  And we’ve had a bit of a journey to get here, too!  Perhaps you were reminded of your mortality at Ash Wednesday.  You may have journeyed throughout all of Lent.  You witnessed the last supper, and on Friday we remembered that Jesus died upon the cross.  We’ve gotten to Sunday, and we expect something - something we can hold onto.  The resurrection moment should be something tangible!

And even though we are referencing some different things, I can appreciate what Isaiah is saying.  I want a world where the tears are wiped away, disgrace is taken away, the shroud is gone, and we are eating well.  I imagine we’d all like to stay up on the mountain of the Lord as long as we could. The journey is long, and it can be hard - it’d be nice to call a nice, safe, well-stocked place home.

For Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, the journey had been hard, too.  None of the words of the gospel seem to express what must have been the anguish that beset those closest to Jesus as they were all witnesses to his death.   But, they stayed faithful to the appointment set before them - they were going to anoint Jesus.  And, so, we read that after the Sabbath, early in the morning, they head to the tomb.  You can imagine they are caught in the haze of grief and the practical questions that bring you through “hey - how do you think we’re going to be able to get into the tomb?  Who can we get to open it for us?”  Once they got there, though, well, they were understandably a little freaked out, for here is someone telling them Jesus isn’t here anymore, but in Galilee.  How do they - how do any of us, for that matter - rectify the certainty of a moment we believe will occur - a moment that we can own and hold as our own - only to have it not be true?  We are caught somewhere “between the promise and its fulfillment and invited to remain there with the others.”(fn) 

This particular in-between space is not easy to live in, and for many of us, it might be downright frightening.  Jesus is not here.  I want to believe that in that moment, I’d be jubilant, but I think if I’m honest, I’d probably do the same thing and the ladies did here.  The expectation of the anticipated coming event had not happened, after all.  The moment on the calendar, no matter how tragic it was no longer there.  Who is this person in the tomb, anyway?  What do they know?  And so, as a result, what we hoped to claim has slipped through our fingers.  However, something more profound occurs at Mark’s retelling of the moment at the tomb.

The Easter Moment gives way to an Easter Movement.  In the telling of the resurrection, Mark invites to consider what it may be like for us to not place Christ’s promise into one blocked space in our calendars to attend to.  In the Gospel, Christ is back in Galilee - back home, back to where his ministry had started just a few years earlier.  The Good News cannot be circumscribed into a time in the past, but continues into a present, and not just a particular present - but by overcoming death, the Good News of Jesus Christ becomes as present and always.  The promise of Jesus Christ is that he did what he said he would do, and that he will continue to do what he’s always done - meet the broken and downtrodden with a message of hope, of restoration, and redemption.  The tomb is not an closed end; a period at the end of the statement of God, but the opened ellipses of the Gospel.

Paul also reminds us that this Good News of which Paul received and sends to the church is also the means in which we are “being saved.”  For some of us, we may be able to point to a moment when we were “saved” - we invite people to gather around a particular place on our spiritual calendars as we tell our testimony.  I remember the day my grandfather, a Church of Christ pastor and my minister growing up, plunged me into the unheated water of a baptistry in Northeastern Ohio.  Maybe you have a moment just like mine, too, or one moment when you sensed the Holy Spirit alive in you.  Maybe it’s when you received your Bible in church after Confirmation classes.  

But that wasn’t it.  Our saved moment is only a guidepost amongst the journey of being saved; the grace of God through Jesus Christ working in us just as it did through Paul, just as Paul noted was happening to the church in Corinth.  We are being rescued by t0he resurrected one, ever and always.  We are always somewhere in the middle of promises and their fulfillment.

But as sure as the tomb rolled away, we know that the promises will be fulfilled.  The fear of a changed expectation is met by the reality that Jesus Christ did what he said he will, not just once, but always, and what he calls us to is what he has always called us to - to follow him.  Back to Galilee - back to those who need to know that they, too, are loved.  That they too have been given the promise of salvation and victory over death.  That perhaps the richness of the mountain of God is not only a space to rest in, but instead the bounty of promises kept.  We must keep walking, Christ going ahead of us to continue the work he set out to do. Our shouts of joy for God’s steadfast love become testament to what God has done and what God will do.  We can’t hold onto and claim just one moment that will carry the wholeness of our faith, but we can hold to the fact that Jesus Christ is always and forever 

And, so, dear brothers and sisters, as we leave this space, and close out this moment on our calendar, let us pray for the grace to remember the promises of this faithful journey.  Let us celebrate the moments of rich food and well-aged wines knowing that God is faithful in God’s promises.  Let us move through the spaces of our lives when we feel all of the world is shrouded, our faces filled with tears, knowing that God is faithful in God’s promises.  Let us give thanks for God’s steadfast love, knowing that God is faithful in God’s promises. And let us journey from the tomb to Galilee and beyond, knowing that God is faithful in God’s promises.

For this - and every day - is the day that the Lord has made.  Let us rejoice and be glad in it.  Amen.
