# Advent II

**Luke 3:1-6** [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Luke/Luke 3]]
3:1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene,
3:2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
3:3 He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth;
3:6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’"

* If you want to get a pulse on the psyche of culture, take a look on Amazon.
* The self-help section is never ending
	* There are thousands of books to make us our better selves.  In particular, there are 70,000 books about making a change in your life.
	* There’s an innate drive in us to be better, to have change
		* PWC: Self-help industry is at least a $9.9b business (2016), and is likely surpassed the $11b mark by now
		* You can be a life coach!  It’s the 2nd fastest growing industry right now.  They make $62k/yr
	* All of these book and the whole industry seems to have a similar theses
		* You’ve recognized you’re in a bad place, not where you thought you’d be or where you want to be
		* Something, somewhere needs to change
		* You follow a prescribed set of steps
		* If you do it right and stick with it, you’ll be more of what you want.
* This can happen with churches, too
	* Lines can blur between worship and self-help seminars
	* It’s where the $ is, so some folks are apt to fashion a church in a similar way that focuses on God as the Holy guru.
	* God will change your life the way you hope, provided you show your faithfulness… sometimes by a monetary blessing.
	* Even with Advent, as we’ve been talking about, it’s easy to just move to Christmas with all of its warm feelings and perhaps skip over some texts that might have to rethink our holy self-help path of restoration.
* When we think we’ve got it figured out, we will plot the course as best we can.
	* Again, this is the core of so much self-help.
	* Luke gives us a who’s-who on people who seem as though they’ve plotted their course and have been successful
		* Emperor Tiberius - Roman billionaire, one of the greatest generals in Roman history
		* Pontius Pilate - the appointed governor of the area
		* Herod and Phillip - the rulers of the area, as vassals of Rome
		* According to Josephus (early Jewish historian), Caiaphas was appointed by Pontius Pilate after his father-in-law, Annas, was deposed.
		* They’ve made their appropriate connections, they’ve all become successful.
	* And for Luke, this is in part to provide a meticulous context for the time that we’re talking about, but I think it’s also important to notice the contrast.
		* The Word of God here doesn’t come to the people who have been the most successful here in this story.
		* It doesn’t even come to the ceremoniously appointed religious leaders.
		* It doesn’t come to the ones who have arrived, but instead the one in the wilderness.
			* John strikes me as a character in a bad bro-buddy film
			* But that’s where God is.
			* And John is proclaiming (herald, making widely known) a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins
				* The activity was a moment for people to completely reconsider their lives: “a change of self that abandons former dispositions and results in a new self, new behavior, and regret over former behavior and dispositions”, and a “formal release from an obligation or debt"
				* Sounds a little like our self-help culture, but not entirely.  
					* We might want to consider new behaviors, but maybe not reflect on our previous behavior
					* We might want to regret our previous behaviors, but we don’t consider how we are released from the debt
					* But its proximity to how we understand Christianity might be exactly the reason why it is so easy for the two to be joined together.  But it means that we are using roadmaps to get where we want to go that aren’t including the places where God might be
					* The concept of repentance, for instance, isn’t nearly as popular: One of the most popular books was about “Cleansing Your Generational Bloodline,” along with Star Trek Voyager episodes, and certainly not commanding $20-25 prices that our other self-help change books command.
					* Wilderness - so often a place of wild-ness, and unexpected Spirit.  Where Jesus goes to be tempted.  
* What happens when the roadmaps fail us because the ground itself is changing?
	
	* This isn’t an unfamiliar thing to us:
		* Google Maps updates weekly because things change
		* Oxbow Lakes
		* East Island - an island in Hawaii that was completely removed by hurricanes this year
	* Our hopes for our own roadmaps will not take us where we think we’re going to go.  It’s why we need the prophets who tell us we’re going a wrong direction and might need recalibrated
	* Stop going the wrong direction because the topography is being completely reworked.  Mountains will go flat, valleys filled in.  This isn’t our doing!
	* “Flesh” - sarx - the _meat_, the whole body, the whole life.  
	* And moreover, the problem may be the destination was wrong to begin with.
	* This is at the core of our confessions
	
	* That the roadmaps we use aren’t the best.  
		* We don’t just make our own solo maps, but we do it collectively.  Our confessions aren’t meant to just be admissions of guilt, but about culturally missing the mark.
		* This isn’t about shame, but about the bad calibration that comes from brokenness in the world, and in each of us.
	* It’s the admonition that the route we’re on isn’t going to go where God is - that the definitions of success and perfection aren’t necessarily the one’s God defines - he’s still with the wild one in the wilderness.  And that we haven’t taken into account the always-changing, always-reshaping of the ground underneath our feet by the all-loving, all-holy Creator of the world.
	* Self-help isn’t always unhelpful, of course, but it can be dangerous if it’s wrapped into the gospel because it invites our human maps to replace the calls of God.
	
	* The forgiveness that we receive is our ability to be freed from our current maps, and invited all the time to head on to different roads.
	* John exposes us to those new roads next week, but for now, as we walk slowly together, maybe we need to recalibrate our maps.
	* Is it about getting what we want, being changed in the ways we hope for, or is it about listening to where God is and following those maps?
