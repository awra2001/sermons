* Growing up in the Church of Christ
	* Fundamentalist in the best sense of the word
	* I got to learn my Bible because that’s all there was
	* But, sometimes, even with that, there’s theology underneath
	* Always felt my sin first.
		* The times late at night I’d pray to God when I was younger
		* The other side, grace, was just God’s willingness to drag me out of my sorry state.
		* Sin was the state of being and grace was a function - maybe not to make me better, but at least not hell bound.
* Becoming Presbyterian
	* I had a shift in understanding - grace wasn’t just a function anymore, but it was also a way of being
	* An imperfect sinner perfectly loved meant that I was still broken, but not thrown away.
* But, it isn’t like that the past doesn’t still have some grip on me… The words of my past are still with me
	* BBT: The creation of worlds from words
		* God invites us to be co-creators
		* Our words, sentences, paragraphs, and stories create worlds.
		* We can end up residing in those worlds
			* The worlds of the churches we reside in, too. 
			* We collectively tell stories
		* Before long, the worlds of our words overtake everything.
			* That’s how passages like today begin to unfold.
				* The Pharisees inhabiting a world of law
				* Seems they’re more interested in the law than the people
			* Many of us as leaders in the church have done this, too.
				* We create worlds with our words and we forget who may also already live in those worlds
				* The world that tells someone that they are less than because of the law
				* That world can influence others - including the disciples!  They’re denying children again!
		* So let me at least say this now: if a text like this has created a world that minimized you because of divorce, I’m sorry.  If you have felt minimized because of texts like Genesis, I’m sorry.  It’s likely you had a Pharisee in your midst who wanted the law right, a disciple shooing away those at their most vulnerable.
* So much of that minimization comes from a world with only the words of sin.
	* Creating a binary system of right and wrong
	* But it minimizes the depth of humanity
		* The binary law ignores the pain of separation, and the pain we can inflict on each other.
		* The binary law ignores how vulnerable we can be to one another
	* It also obscures what Jesus is doing and what the text might tell us - providing words of grace
		* Mark
			* Women were generally considered property and marriages were ways of getting ahead
			* Midrash on divorce made it really simple for men and not for women.
			* Jesus elevates a woman - not just economic but also human, while also recognizing how painful those kinds of separations can be.
		* Genesis
			* Helper is often used in reference to God, not diminutive
			* That God made us for each other in partnership, not dominion.
* But what if sin is not the only world?  What if we enter into a world of grace?
	* It might mean tending to the broken spirit after divorce, not just the hard law.
	* It may mean we welcome the most vulnerable to Jesus and not just shoo them away, so that they may be loved.
	* After all, this is God brought low to be with us: how could we want to have anyone be away?
* There is grace for you
	* We are broken, but God came near.
	* We are forgiven.
	* We are more than the law
	* God meets us in the pain of broken life, broken hope, broken relationship sand asked we not be sternly talked to in order to stay away, but are invited to share in the holy Commonwealth.
* There is grace for others.
	* Who are those that we as disciples speak sternly against coming to Jesus?
		* What law do we want to clarify but miss the human heart?
		* What do we miss by living into the worlds of sin when Jesus offers grace to us?
	* World Communion Sunday
		* The entire worlds remembers together
		* Every tribe, nation, celebrate this meal
		* A table of grace.
