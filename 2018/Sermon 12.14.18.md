# Advent III

Luke 3:1-6 [[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Luke/Luke 3]]
3:1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruler of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene,
3:2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
3:3 He went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
3:5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways made smooth;
3:6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"

* Self help recap from last week: the simple steps for the perfect solution can fail us
* Of course, with everything, there can be an equal and opposite reaction, and the further criticism of a self-help culture is that we have a sense of entitlement.
* Entitlement
	
	* "believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privilege or special treatment"
	* Looking at Google and most searches will come back regarding our entitlement culture in government - that we have programs that support people.  We even call them "entitlement" programs.  If we took that literally, the argument would go that Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, Social Security all programs for people who believe themselves to be deserving of privilege or special treatment.  That tends to be a predominant lens.
	
	* Mr. Rogers and his legacy took a lot of criticism in the late 2000s
		* That children were particularly entitled
		* There were studies around then about why students would ask for higher grades from professors, and the blame was centered on watching Mr. Rogers
		* Fox and Friends ran a couple pieces on it, and one thing that sticks out: "You think you're special?  Prove it!"
	* Amazon: the thesis is often that the cure to entitlement is hard work.  "You think you're so special?  Prove it!"  Often the same criticism for entitlement programs.  Example: 
	* And that entitlement culture can just as easily creep into our churches - as easily as a self-help culture can.
		* In my own life I've vacillated between two trains of thought
			* I need to prove that I am worthy of this gift - pray harder, denounce the world, and judge those who don't work as hard and prove their as worthy as I am.
			* I have done so, so much to prove that I am a faithful person - so maybe I am entitled.  

3:7 John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
3:8 Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our ancestor'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
3:9 Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
3:10 And the crowds asked him, "What then should we do?"
3:11 In reply he said to them, "Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise."
3:12 Even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?"
3:13 He said to them, "Collect no more than the amount prescribed for you."
3:14 Soldiers also asked him, "And we, what should we do?" He said to them, "Do not extort money from anyone by threats or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages."
3:15 As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah,
3:16 John answered all of them by saying, "I baptize you with water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
3:17 His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."
3:18 So, with many other exhortations, he proclaimed the good news to the people.

* Brood of vipers.  Let's not forget, John is talking to the people that were following him the first place.  The folks who he was literally going around the region preaching to.
	
	* Brood of vipers is often a term used to describe Gentiles
		* But let's not presume it's just Gentiles here.  Indeed, there are also "ancestor or Abraham"
	
	* People who had the benefit of entitlement - literally being the people of God - could not just stand on that alone.
	
	* We cannot just think because we have the right pedigree, prayed the right prayers - just don't think you can wander in here and be baptized and not escape what's to come.
	* Instead, there need to be fruits worthy of "repentance"
		* Remember: repentance - a complete change of the self that abandons former dispositions and results in a new self, new behavior, and regret over former behavior and dispositions.
		* John's exhortation is that we need to deny the entitlements based on who we are and change our ways.
* "What then should we do?"
	* I think there are all sorts of ways to fill in those blanks... some we're already touched on
		* Clickbait Christianity
		* We pray harder
		* We work harder
		* We keep trying to prove ourselves
	* John's response - Do good and love others.  This is the greatest commandment in action.
		* If you have enough - give some to others!
			* Notice two coats - not just one and then you have none.
			* Things that provide for basic needs.
		* Don't take advantage of people economically.
			* Even tax collectors - sorry for the tax people in the room.  But maybe we think more broadly - the related Hebrew word was one that also meant "to force to work."  
			* How many of us are in positions of authority over someone?  Bosses, managers, teachers, pastors?  
			* We all know the stories of the supervisors who took advantage of us.
			* "Collect no more than the amount prescribed to you"
				* The word prescribed can also mean instructed.
				* No only might it offer economic relief, but also that we not require more of people than what they can muster.
		* The soldier
			* Jewish soldiers - the governmental representatives
			* Extort - to shake fiercely.  A specific use here.  Don't use violence.
			* Extort - to lie about.  Blackmailing others.  
			* Be happy with what you have - when you have power, it's so easy to push around the weakest.  
	* One thing that's not here - be concerned about what the other guy has.
		* Only give that coat to the person who has none only if you think they really deserve it.
		* Only feed that person if they're working in order that we can see that they deserve it.
		* To give with strings doesn't seem to be repentance - it's just entitlement by another name, which may be the worse giving of them all.
			* And there will always be fine lines between care and enablement, but that's not what we are talking about here.
			* Sometimes we need to not give one thing, but we need to give something.
			* But there seems to be something far too snake-like when we say "well, we'll give to you so long as you meet our requirements" - it reflections our own entitlement, our own judgement to determine who is worthy and who isn't.
			* Ironically, it seems to sound more like Mr. Rogers again, and less like Fox and Friends - everyone is special.  Everyone is deserving of care.  Everyone is worthy of love.  No one needs to prove that.  Our repentance (our change of self) is to give.  Not in reference to the person being given to, but in reference to our own growth in faithful journeying.  Our preparation in Advent.
* If week 1 was the call to worship, week 2 was our confession, this week is our sending.
	* Go out into the world to love God and each other by serving God and one another.
	* That calling out is not shaped by self-help or entitlement, but in repentant service
	* Espalier tree
		* If you're around me long enough, you'll hear me talk about the two I had in Westgate
		* Espalier started with monks in France who wanted to get more out of their growing season
		* They started to grow trees against the wall.  Pruning them back helped them receiving more warm sun, and meant that they could bear fruit longer.
		* Espalier is hard work
			* You start with young trees
			* You get guide wires and you train them to grow on those guide wires
			* Progressively, they shape themselves on them
			* And in particular, trees like apples bear more fruit.  Their systems are stronger.  There are some espalier trees alive still that were fences for George Washington's estate.
		* They don't necessarily look like how they would if they were just out in a field somewhere
		* But they do look beautiful, and they're doing the thing that they're called to do.  They just need some training and pruning.
		* John's call here in advent is a chance to consider our spiritual espalier
			* Our entitled selves might bear fruit, but left alone, they might not, and certainly they won't be as sweet or as bountiful.
			* Instead, what would it be like to be under the wires and pruning of repentance - of a complete and total life change?
			* What is it like to seek repentance from the Master Gardener?
			* It may mean that we are our best selves, bearing fruit to give away to whomever needs it.
		* That's love, but it's only a small sliver of the love to come, in just a short time.
