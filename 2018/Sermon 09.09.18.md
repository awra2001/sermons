# The Songs Outside The House

###Mark 7:24-37
7:24 From there he set out and went away to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice,
7:25 but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet.
7:26 Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
7:27 He said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
7:28 But she answered him, "Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
7:29 Then he said to her, "For saying that, you may go--the demon has left your daughter."
7:30 So she went home, found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
7:31 Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis.
7:32 They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him.
7:33 He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.
7:34 Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened."
7:35 And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.
7:36 Then Jesus ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.
7:37 They were astounded beyond measure, saying, "He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."

* Jesus just wants a break.  You try doing his job for awhile.  Lots of folks asking for help, and if you remember not so long ago it seems like what he was able to do was being diminished.  He could “only heal a few people"
	* That seems fair - we too need a rest from the milieu of the world.
	* Are you tired of the Nike ad craziness yet, for instance?
		* People don’t like Colin Kaepernick
		* People don’t like Nike
		* People don’t like what Colin Kaepernick doesn’t like
	* Sometimes we just want to be with our people with things like the Nike ad, or pick any other topic.  
		* Pew Study: During the last election, most folks didn’t have friends that voted for the other person.
		* Church can operate like that sometimes, too, for better or for worse.
			* Yeah, of course we need places of rest, but how far can/should that go?
			* This time is still one of the most segregated times in our country
			* But that segregation often isn’t just racial segregation anymore.
			* We often want to hear messages that affirm where we are at and ease our minds.
				* There’s enough work to do outside of here to add more: we’re tired.
				* There’s so much going on and it hurts us: we’re afraid.
	* So, sometimes, we just need a break.  We need to take a vacation.
* Mark 7
	* Vacation vs. trip.
	* Jesus starts taking a vacation, but it seems to end with a trip.
		* Tyre’s a long way away: 40 miles or so.  Far enough that he was hope to go incognito: grab a bite and relax in a home.
		* However, this didn’t happen.  And now he’s in a foreign land away from home and having to care for someone.
	* Jesus encounters the Syrophonecian woman
		* The woman is not part of Jesus’ tribe
			* Syrians and Phonecians have long, painful histories with the Jews - they’re going to have reasons to avoid each other.
			* But her daughter is in trouble and she asks for help, doing what any good parent might do at the end of her rope.
		* The temptation is to want to clean Jesus’ decision making up here
			* For Jesus to call anyone a dog, let alone a mother asking for help seems cruel and perhaps a little short-sighted
			* Also hard because he’s arguing for a type of hierarchy of grace, restricting who gets what.  That the gifts of grace are somehow scarce enough that only some people get them.
			* By not sanitizing this conversation, however, we may see God’s leading Jesus into a difficult place in a way that is more honest to our stories.  
				* We have dogs in our lives, too
				* People who our initial thoughts lead us to believe that they somehow miss out on God’s abundant grace.
	* The dialogue changes Jesus’ mind.
		* Jesus doesn’t head back home.
		* In fact, it seems he keeps going further afield, down on the other side of the Sea of Galilee to the Decapolis, which was very Greek and heals again
		* God is there! Jesus is healing in a way that just a little while ago we were reminded that wasn’t happening in his hometown
			* The people back home kept questioning Jesus and who he was “Isn’t this just the carpenter’s kid?"
			* His own ability to heal apparently had diminished.
			* But here was God, away from home, with the dogs under the table, providing more than scraps.
* God is restoring sight, sound, and song for people all over who we’d prefer to stay blind, deaf, and dumb.
	* It’s easy for us to be fine with healing of those who are similar to us, perhaps our favorite missions and ministries
	* We are okay that folks receiving healing who really “deserve” it: it hasn’t been that long since the story of Sheriff Richard Jones of Butler County down the road who said he wouldn’t permit his deputies to carry Narcan: _“We don't do the shots for bee stings, we don't inject diabetic people with insulin. When does it stop?” he told The Washington Post.  “I'm not the one that decides if people live or die. They decide that when they stick that needle in their arm.”_
		* I’m tired of hearing about Colin Kaepernick (and systemic racism)
		* I’m tired of hearing about Nike (and poor labor practices overseas)
		* I’m tired of hearing about people like my dad (and poor labor practices right at home)
	* We can then get caught up in keeping our distance from it all: a “thoughts-and-prayers” mentality, which is its own terrible kind of scarcity.
	* But our favorites may be who betrays us - our favorites lead us into scarcity, deny us a chance to see God’s healing in places we don’t expect it or don’t want it to happen.  We lose the chance to hear the songs of joy and celebration outside of our own house.
* As we start our year again fresh off of vacations, I pray that we are all able to get to where God is and also where we’d prefer to not go, because there more than anywhere else we will witness the unfiltered work of God in our midst.
	* Where we are the outsider looking in and listening, bringing messages of hope and healing
	* Where we are willing perhaps to have our minds changed (maybe even this message itself is an uncomfortable place to be)
	* Where we can find mothers pleading for their daughter’s healing
	* Where we can hear the cries of someone who senses systemic oppression in their midst
		* Race
		* Class
	* But there, in those places, are where God is bringing healing.
* Let’s go and go uncomfortably, for then we know it is God who guides.
