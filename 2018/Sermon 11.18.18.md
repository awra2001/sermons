# Learning Again for The First Time

38 As he taught, he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, 39 and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets! 40 They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”

41 He sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. 42 A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which are worth a penny. 43 Then he called his disciples and said to them, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. 44 For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”

* Winter takes some adjusting to get back into.
	* Different ways that happens:
		* Didn’t expect it so soon
		* Chill reaches into the bones a little more than expected.
		* Coats don’t fit they way they used to
		* Windows are a bit more drafty than you remember
		* The time change!
	* But we all get used to it again
		* You know that chill will hit you
		* You pull out the extra coat out in the back of the closet
		* The plastic goes up on the windows, the rakes go down
	* But there’s always this space on either side of the freezing point that we forget a little bit.
	* And so we have to learn winter again for the first time.
		* Not the only thing we seem to have to learn again for the first time
			* Second kid?  Relearning diapers, sleep schedules, going out to eat, etc
			* Each new job seems to bring its new rhythms
			* And, it’s the same with faith, too.
				* We’re still here after confirmation, after our baptism
				* We show up, week after week, tying to understand 
				* Our rhythms in faith, year after year, week after week, are all in part helping us learn again the life that we have called to.
* In the first reading in Mark, one we heard last week, too, we are give the keys to our tradition: the master thesis to the story of our lives.
	* The two commandments
		* Love God: the Holy, God - the one who created the world, set it all into motion.  Not just any God.
			* …with all the heart: our center life (passion)
			* …with all the soul: the seat of feeling that is more than just the physical life (prayer)
			* …all of our mind: our facilities of understanding (intelligence)
			* …and our strength: all our abilities (energy)
			* This is an all-consuming love of God
		* Love our neighbor as ourselves: love the people near us as well as we care for ourselves.
	* This is simple to speak, simple to hear, but we spend our entire lifetimes here on earth trying to figure out how to live it.
		* The scribe retelling the story
		* There was something important here to have him retell it - that even he, who was deeply engaged in this work, would need to hear and speak it again - learning again for the first time.
	* There are lots of different ways that might be obvious that we can do this:
		* Worship - our rhythms in worship and reflections of our lives
		* CE - we come to learn, our minds are shaped to hear the story again
		* Mission - we learn again to go out into the world and we serve
		* But one other way that we can engage this learning again is through stewardship
			* Stewardship - Concept of being charged with care taking of the world
			* Stewardship is the embodiment of loving God, the neighbor, and ourselves.
			* Our giving of whatever - our embodiment of caring by expending portions of what we have and what we are - is a way to walk into a new season again; a way to learn again.  Each time we are readdressing our spiritual houses as the temperature changes… we’re trying back on the coats of our faithfulness.
* The questions around stewardship in these texts don’t necessarily center around amount, but attitude.
	
	* The scribe and then widow
		* Scribe
			* Long robes indicated wealth and power
			* Focused on the elevation of the self
				* Greeted with respect
				* Best seats at the church
				* Places of honor at banquets
			* Devour (use up excessively and uselessly) the widow’s house - belief that the scribes at the time may have been extorting money from prayer or care taking or some other means (Loving self more than neighbor, at expense of neighbor)
			* Say long prayers - they hide what they’re doing
		* Widow
			* Described as poor
			* Widows were the marginalized in society
			* Gives what she has, and doesn’t hide who she is
	* If we hold these two together in our minds and compare them, we see that for Jesus, stewardship isn’t about what you give, but it’s the heart that counts.
	* This goes beyond “God loves a cheerful giver” it is being concerned about loving God with everything we are, and loving our neighbor what whatever we can muster as we love ourselves
	* It’s so easy to forget how that works
		* Things can become rote - we give our pledge, we perform our responsibilities and we don’t investigate why
		* We in the west are always going to struggle being more scribes than widows - and it’s always going to be easy to find a group of “those people"
			* We might even give our time and tithes for “those people,” but I think it still leads positions us more as scribes and less as widows
			* Personally, I’m not sure that it is a whole lot better, especially if we’re elevated, to point out the devouring of widow’s houses and feel bad about it than it is to devour them.
			* And maybe we can live for awhile in a consistent space, but sooner or later the change comes, and we’ve somehow forgotten what things we like the last time - we forget what the cold feels like.
	
	* We need steady reminders, we need to learn again for the first time.
* Learning again through stewardship
	* And so stewardship can be a moment where we learn again to be caretakers.
		* To love God with everything we are
		* To love our neighbor well and not devour their homes
	* This means, in part, that perhaps we don’t get as focused on amounts, especially financial, but instead of finding new ways to love God, the neighbor, and ourselves
		* Some of us have money, some of us have time, some of us have particular talents that might be called on “for such a time as this"
		* I know I don’t care what you talent is, but I do deeply care that you have the opportunity to use it here. 
		* The nitty-gritty, back-of-napkin calculation would be if every member of the church gave about $30/week, we’d cover our budget with money left over.
			* Maybe you give more than that - great!
			* Maybe that’s what you give - great!
			* Maybe you can give that and you haven’t - maybe you can?
			* Maybe you can’t give that and you know you can’t - that’s okay too.  Maybe $1/week?
		* Maybe you’ve already signed up your pledge and your T&T cards - the question may be for you to think about what it means for you.  What does it mean to give?  We all need to keep asking that question.
	* In the end, this isn’t just about our budget or our programs, making sure we have the things we enjoy, but it’s about love.  It’s about loving the people around us.  Loving the past and the way others prepared for us being here, and a way to love the future as we think about those who will come after us.  Every part of our lives become moments for stewardship, every time we talk to someone is a chance to steward them.
