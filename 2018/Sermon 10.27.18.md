# Crowding Out The Witnesses

46 They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. 47 When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 48 Many sternly ordered him to be quiet, but he cried out even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 49 Jesus stood still and said, “Call him here.” And they called the blind man, saying to him, “Take heart; get up, he is calling you.” 50 So throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. 51 Then Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “My teacher, let me see again.” 52 Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has made you well.” Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the way.

* The (unbelievable) goal
	* I want to be a triathlete
		* I remember the first time I saw the final at Kona.
			* I was sick at home, and watched these athletes swim and run and bike for hours and hour on end.
			* I was impressed at their skill and just that they could make it through such a daunting task.
		* Back then, I knew I’d like to try it.
		* But, y’know how that goes.
			* Not the body type for a triathlon
			* My schedule is far more demanding now than it used to be.
		* So there’s this part of me that thinks if I’m going to follow through, I should tell you all - have an accountability team!
			* Except, we’re not always the best at helping one another in the area of goals.
			* Most research says if we want to succeed in something, we ought to keep it to ourselves.
				* Gollwitzer et al 2009 - When a goal is tied to our identity, receiving praise might make you feel like you’ve already done the work. (<http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf>)
				* Haimovitz and Corpus 2011 - The more we praise the person and not the process, the more apt we are to not do well when failure happens (<https://www.reed.edu/motivation/docs/Haimovitz_Corpus_2011.pdf>)
				* And then, of course, there are the times that we just don’t believe it.
					* Based on some of the basic evidence at hand, you’d have every right to assume that the idea of me competing in a triathlon is not a likely outcome, and you’d need no apology.
					* Maybe we think we saving someone from kind of failure
					* Maybe we’re being realistic

	* When we hear these texts, I think the first characters we examine are the main protagonists
		* In Job - we focus on Job himself, his trails, and then his restoration.
		* When we listen to Mark, we focus on Bartamaues (the fact that he’s even named is a big deal!) and of course Jesus.
		* But, in each text, there’s another player that affects the whole narrative - the crowd.
	* Job
		* Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.
			* Their first move in Job was to sit with him in his pain.  
			* Job got angry.  Job didn’t understand.  When something of gravity and magnitude happens for what seems to be no good reason, you can appreciate how he feels.
			* And at first, they do well… and then they try to fix things.
			* And you can spend a good portion of a few days a little at a time sitting with their discourses.
			* And they sound really familiar to us.  Friends in the crowd who remind us why we're suffering.
				* If you were more faithful.
				* If you had done x, y, or z - or _hadn’t_ done x, y, z.
		* In the chapters leading up to this moment, we are reminded that God is a big deal.  God is powerful, God will do what God will do.  
			* Job gets that.  
			* And then God turns to Job’s friends.
				* The mismatch in the translation.
				* Hear The Message:  After God had finished addressing Job, he turned to Eliphaz the Temanite and said, “I’ve had it with you and your two friends. I’m fed up! You haven’t been honest either with me or about me—not the way my friend Job has. So here’s what you must do. Take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my friend Job. Sacrifice a burnt offering on your own behalf. My friend Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer. He will ask me not to treat you as you deserve for talking nonsense about me, and for not being honest with me, as he has.” Eugene H. Peterson, _The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language_ (Colorado Springs, CO: NavPress, 2005), Job 42:7–8.
				* It seems as though the friends had missed the point of it all.  They were so busy trying to fix what was wrong with Job that they forgot about God.  
	
	* Mark
		* I imagine what a blind beggar in Roman times must have been like. Economic distress imposed another duty toward the blind. A few were well off, but the majority lived in dire poverty. Many blind men are beggars ἀλήμονες (wanderers), Anth. Graec., 9, 13b, cf. ἀλητεύων, 9, 12. To be sure, some are also singers and musicians, Hom. Od., 8, 62–64, poets, e.g., Homer, Suid., 251 (Adler, III, 526, 8 ff.), seers, e.g., Tiresins (→ n. 15) and philosophers, e.g., Democr. (→ 273, 8 ff.), even jurists, Cic. Tusc., V, 38, 112, statesmen, Valerius Maximus Dictorum factorumque memorabilia, VIII, 7, 4 f. and kings, Hdt., II, 137, 1; Dio C., 51, 23, 4,13 but such vocations were closed to the mass of less talented blind people.  Wolfgang Schrage, “Τυφλός, Τυφλόω,” ed. Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, and Gerhard Friedrich, _Theological Dictionary of the New Testament_ (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1964–), 272.
		* This is an easily forgettable, easily toss aside person.  
			* But this was a person.
			* Mark makes an effort to tell us that.  He’s named.  He’s someone’s son.
		* He heard Jesus, and cried out.
			* The crowd wanted him to stop.
			* We don’t know what was happening in the crowd - Jesus may have been teaching - but I imagine that it’s a crowd like any other
			* Then this isn’t some kind of frustration at an outburst in a lecture.  It’s derision.  It’s frustration.  Because what blind man gets to get near Jesus?
			* This wouldn’t stop him though, he cried out more loudly in the dark.
			* Jesus stops.
				* And what’s interesting is that he doesn’t call him, but he asks the crowd to invite him.
				* Parallel to Job - the crowd has missed the point and needs restoration.  
			* When the crowd called, Bartimaeus let go of everything - I imagine perhaps one of his only earthly possessions - and he goes to Jesus.  
				* Jesus asks what he wants.  Jesus doesn’t tell him what he needs to do, doesn’t judge his station in life.  He asks what he wants.
				* Bartimaeus, just not so long ago the tossed to the side by the crowd, is now at the center.  He only asks for sight.
				* Jesus restores it - and Bartimaeus follows him!
		* I wonder what the crowd thought then.
			* They witnessed a miracle they were willing not to occur
			* They had passed judgement on someone who Jesus did not
			* But once they heard the call of Jesus, they were assistants in the healing.
* As one of the crowd...
	
	* As individuals - The worst cheerleaders
		* Our call is not to discern the end goal, but to be faithful to the process.
			* Because we don’t know when the end result might actually happen!
				* Job was restored double what he was!
				* Bartimaeus got to see again!
				* I might get to Kona!
			* …but we also don’t know when the end result won’t.
				* Job could have ended up penniless
				* Bartimaeus could have stayed blind.
				* My leg could break training.
				* Someone’s sickness might not go away.
	
	* When the church crowds out its witnesses
		* We all too often as the church have crowded out the witness who wanted to seek Jesus
			* We want to quiet the ones who are on the fringes - how could they be what the savior is asking for?
			* When we hear them, we want to quiet them too often as well.
			* Or, we need to continue to point out the blind person, trying to fix their blindness on our own.
				* My best guess is that someone who is blind is perfectly aware of their blindness and don’t need to have someone point out.
				* My best guess is what they need is someone to encourage them on their journey.  To shout with them, to lead them to a place where they can get healed, and not only after we hear the reminder from Jesus, the shame of Adonai.
	* I wonder in the end where we could put our energy individually and corporately.
		* I’d rather spend my time leading people to get healed than determining their blindness.
		* I’d rather trust that God will do what God will do and just be faithful.
		* Each one of us today is sitting with some blindness, waiting to hear Jesus say again “What do you want me to do for you,” and each of us is yelling out of the crowd to hush.  Faithfulness is reaching out and being with each other.
			* So let’s share.  Let’s walk.  Let’s call on God.  Let’s believe that Jesus is asking what we need.  Let’s head towards Jesus.  Let’s bring along everyone we can.
