# Autumnal Saints

32 When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she knelt at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was greatly disturbed in spirit and deeply moved. 34 He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus began to weep. 36 So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” 37 But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”

38 Then Jesus, again greatly disturbed, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. 39 Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.” 40 Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you for having heard me. 42 I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.” 43 When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” 44 The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.”

* Maybe it as being away but the fall this year has seemed particularly beautiful this year.
	
	* Reds and yellows seem especially bright
	* And it seems like every tree has revealed their best hues
		* This might actually be true: Temperature, light, and water supply have an influence on the degree and the duration of fall color. Low temperatures above freezing will favor anthocyanin formation producing bright reds in maples. However, early frost will weaken the brilliant red color. Rainy and/or overcast days tend to increase the intensity of fall colors. The best time to enjoy the autumn color would be on a clear, dry, and cool (not freezing) day.

	* Autumn is such a beautiful season, but it carries mixed messages.
	
	* If this was your first autumn and you could remember, could you imagine in the feeling?
		* You’ve watched these alive, beautiful trees reach out to the sky.
		* Then, suddenly, they change their colors from greens to all other sorts of beautiful colors!
		* Then they begin to fall steadily until they’re gone, disappearing eventually into a snowy blankness, slowly darker night.
		* If we thought that this was it, if we knew that the autumn change led only to death, we might curse it, fear it.
	* But, thankfully, we know that this autumn gives way to the coming winter, which will eventually give way to another verdant spring.
		* The time of winter can be bleak, yes, but it’s giving way to new life
		* We can keep in mind that no season has a final say but will move to the next.
	* So we’re caught in autumn between life and death, growth and decay
		* Which is similar to our lives
		* Our culture, our own lives with each other, even our own life is somewhere in between.
* In the gospel today, we witness Martha and Mary gazing into winter.
	* They had both been with Lazarus, and had shared life with him - the warmth of summer and surely the color of autumn
	* But now, Lazarus is dead, and dead for enough time that it is clear.  The world is darker, colder to them.
	* And Mary says to Jesus that he could have stopped this from happening.  Other folks, of course at this point can wonder the same thing.
	* And Jesus is moved.
		* He doesn’t just float above it
		* Instead, he enters right into the human pain with Mary and Martha
		* God in human form shares in the pain that we feel.  
	* Jesus then heads towards the tomb
		* Martha’s logical remark - Jesus, winter is upon us.  The leaves have fallen, and are turned under.
			* She’s right, of course.  Four days is a long time.  
			* Jesus’ response shouldn’t be seen a rebuke of someone who had little faith, but a honest reminder about the difficulty of what we believe, the toughest part of the mixed messages of in-between life: that even though there is winter, new life is there.
		* “Father, I thank you for having heard me."
			* Jesus always knew. 
			* These are the promises always-given to us from God.  Isa reminds us that.
			* This message has been carried by God’s people for millennia.
		* Lazarus comes forth from the tomb
			* Jesus overcomes death, God overcomes death
			* The decay of winter is not the final say - even within the decay new life comes forth.
			* "The whole story of the raising of Lazarus is for us to realize that resurrection is not just our future promise but our present reality… that life with God, because of God, lived in the promises of God, is here and now when our neighbor is loved, that we are all made in the image of God.” (Karoline Lewis <http://www.workingpreacher.org/craft.aspx?m=4377&post=5243>)
* We, all who have come before us, and all who come after us, live as Autumnal Saints
	* We are rooted into God’s Created world, given life through the trunks and branches of the church
	* We breathe and exhale the spirit around us, we too bring life to this creation because of who we are and what we are connected to
	* And as the world might grow steadily dimmer, we shine brighter, we are radiant with the colors that have always been within us.  
	* And yes, someday we will fall from the tree.  We will find ourselves back to the Creation again
	* But each leaf brings continued life to this world - feeding the world once again.  The saints that have come before us sustain us, as we will do for those who come after us.
