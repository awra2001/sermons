# Advent I

“There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in a cloud’ with power and great glory. Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

“Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day does not catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”

* Highway Hypnosis
	* 1921: A paper about “Road Hypnotism” about people traveling along roads that dwindled to a far horizon tended to enter a “trance-like state."
	* 1929: People in monotonous situations tended to enter a sleep-like state without closing their eyes.
	* Three causes that tend to be linked 
		* Monotony of the Task
		* Fatigue and boredom of the driver
		* Ease of the driving experience
	* We’re getting to the goal, but somehow we’re missing a lot of the signs along the way.
	* And, provided that we’re safe, maybe it might not matter so much.
		* Boring scenery is, well, boring.
		* And the journey isn’t always important to us compared to the destination.
* That can be an approach to this season as well.
	
	* We’re driving right towards Christmas
	* Everything that we get to look forward to
		* The shopping
		* The family
		* The baby Jesus
	
	* This approach can also presume that we feel the same way about Advent as we might a long, flat highway.
		* The monotony of the task
		* The fatigue
		* Ease of the driving experience
		* I wonder if that’s why it’s so easy to want to mothball seasons
* The danger of the holidaze
	* The reality though is that in our holiday daze, we are dealing with the same dangers as though we were driving
	* Holiday blues are real!
		* Happiness and love accompanied by fatigue, stress, irritability, bloating, and sadness
		* 38% - stress increases during the holidays.  Stressors: lack of time, lack of money, commercialism, pressures of gift-giving, family gatherings
		* 56% - more stress at work, 29% - more stress at home.
	* Our hearts tend to be weighed down with numbness
		* Lk: the weighed down here of physical burden from the pressure of worldly cares
			* It’s interesting to place “dissipation” (unrestrained drunken behavior) and drunkenness (the act of becoming drunk) with worries 
			* The numbing daze doesn’t carry the relief we anticipate.  
	* And perhaps overtly, perhaps within our hearts, we wonder why we’re not feeling the same wonder, why we don’t sense God as much
	* Why is it that Jesus’ birth seems less and less important, less impactful?
* Signs for the journey
	* What if we got off an exit for a second, and perhaps we’re so quick to get to the destination?
	* This is where our passage in Luke is situated
		* Before this passage, Jesus has just gone through a pretty serious discourse of challenging the authorities, and after this, the passion will begin: Jesus will be heading to his death
		* We might have expected it easy just to head into the end, to the destination
		* But instead, we’re taking a stop.
			* I realize that this stop, in which we’re talking in the gospel isn’t much appealing, and doesn’t sound much like Christmas.
			* But, I think it makes it more honest.
				* As much as we try to run from the things happening in this world, and as much as we want to tunnel vision our lives, the world will not leave us, the difficulties we see will not disappear.  And, in fact, they may be more likely to cause us danger in our hypnotic state.
				* But Jesus invites to take heart - that in the midst of difficult signs, Jesus is near.
				* This is the definition of our Christian hope - our eschatology.  That there is resolve in the end.  That the world need not to be driven through in stupor or hypnotically, but engaged with hopefully.  
				* And these are not the only signs - Jeremiah, in the midst of utter and complete devastation, wrote these words as the people watched their family be carted away into slavery.
				* Jeremiah himself is in prison during a foreign invasion - but in the midst of all of that, we hear his vision of hope.
				* We hear Jesus, of course, but the people wouldn’t have heard Jesus.  But they did see the temple restored.  They were able to return home.
				* And then the temple was destroyed again - right when Luke was being written.  
	* These cycles and signs are a part of our in-between living between already and not yet, between creation and consummation.
		* And that’s where we are in Advent, as well.
		* We’re anticipating the Christ child in the midst of him having already come, dying, and resurrecting.
		* We were told he’s coming again
		* And we could always try to zip past in anticipation of return, but we’ll numb ourselves to what can happen here.
		* I Thes: we can also diminish the love in the interim.  
* A holy pause
	* The plan and the theme for Advent this year is to be able to pause.  To snap one another out of our hypnosis, and to stop and look at the horizon together.  To literally live inside advent this year - the wreath surrounding us vs. in a corner somewhere.  To engage you in questions.  To invite you to think about every service here not as independent spots but as one continuous spread.
	* It’s not always going to be beautiful.  It might be difficult, unattractive.  
	* But there is always, always hope
	* The texts invite us to witness.  To engage, to be made aware, and not to numb ourselves.  In engagement, we are able to see what God is doing and where God is going.  We can hear the other voices inviting us.
