# Being Transformed

**Romans 12:1-8**
12:1 I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
12:2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of God--what is good and acceptable and perfect.
12:3 For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
12:4 For as in one body we have many members, and not all the members have the same function,
12:5 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another.
12:6 We have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us: prophecy, in proportion to faith;
12:7 ministry, in ministering; the teacher, in teaching;
12:8 the exhorter, in exhortation; the giver, in generosity; the leader, in diligence; the compassionate, in cheerfulness.

**Matthew 16:13-20**
16:13 Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
16:14 And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
16:15 He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
16:16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
16:17 And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.
16:18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
16:20 Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.

* In our Romans passage, Paul opens us up to think about different ways that we worship.  That in this circumstance, our worship has to do with our whole bodies being offered on an altar.  
* While we often like to work with metaphor, it’s helpful that the Greek and what Paul is saying isn’t just talking about our minds, or our emotions.  This was meant for us to think about the total package of who we are - mind, body, soul, etc.
* We hear v. 2 all the time - don’t be conformed, but be renewed… that sounds great.  Often it’s used as another way to think about not sinning, but it seems like so much more than that.  Maybe a better way to think about it is how we can “repattern ourselves”. Paul gives us a path.
	* Reestabilsh our intellect to prove God’s will.
		* Often, when we talk of God, we use a lot of words of emotion.  We feel God.
		* But God does give us an intellect.  Our reformed heritage reminds us that is such a gift.
		* Paul invites us to pay attention, read the signs, get the evidence.  Especially important as we think about what’s it’s like to not be patterns after the world.
	* Keep calm and carry on.
		* “More highly of yourselves” is easy to read as arrogance, but it’s something a little different than that.
		* It’s more of an ideal… one commentary uses a contrast of super mindedness vs. sober mindedness
		* We might all have different gifts from each other (and in a minute we’ll talk about how that’s special and important), but we shouldn’t presume that with our skill we can be a hero or a tyrant.
		* Ideally, we bring our best sober judgment to others strongly and honestly.  We are serious and self-controlled, but we don’t use that over someone.  And we expect others to do the same
		* This is the Greco-Roman ideal of the _polis_ or the state that Paul was so deeply steeped in.
	* Remember we each have a role.
		* We’ve all been set aside to do certain things.
		* Again, we don’t get overly excited when we are some gift or someone is another.
* Peter give us an example of this working  
	* Peter, even in his occasional bumbling, even in his denials, he’s counted the evidence in his own mind against the world, “repatterining” himself.
	* Even his assessment of Jesus wasn’t something super excited or exclaimed, but a sober minded assessment of who Jesus is.
	* Peter was called to lead the church.  Doesn’t mean that the other disciples were worthless, but also doesn’t mean that Peter didn’t have a particular calling, either.  God had assigned the task.
* How do we live this?
	* This is a time that is just rife with the desires to conform or to be so super-minded as to neglect sober mindedness
	* Every Facebook fight about something related to COVID… every Q-Anon post.  Every conspiracy… it all adds up.
	* But what’s it like to seek God sober-mindedly?
		* It might be what we always do, but maybe being willing to dig deeper.
		* It may be living into what makes us who we are more honestly.
		* It may be offering everything that we all - mind, body, soul, spirit - as an offering to God.
