Opening Setences
God sent Christ into the world
not to condemn the world,
but that the world might be saved through him.
**God’s love endures forever.**

God is our refuge and strength,
a present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear
though the earth should change,
though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea;
though the waters roar and foam,
though the mountains tremble with its tumult.
**God’s love endures forever.**

Prayer of the Day
Almighty God,
you despise nothing you have made
and you forgive the sins of all who trust in you.
Create in us new and contrite hearts,
that truly repenting of our sins,
and acknowledging our brokenness,
we may receive from you, the God of all mercy,
full pardon and forgiveness;
through your Son, Jesus Christ our redeemer,
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and forever. Amen.

Hymn:  Holiness

Prayer for Illumination
Merciful God,
your word is our way of truth and life.
Create in us hearts that are clean
and put your Holy Spirit within us,
so that we may receive your grace
and declare your praise forever;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

_First Reading:_ _Isaiah 58:1–12 (NRSV)_
1Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up your voice like a trumpet! Announce to my people their rebellion, to the house of Jacob their sins.
2Yet day after day they seek me and delight to know my ways, as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness and did not forsake the ordinance of their God; they ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.
3“Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?” Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers.
4Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.
5Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord?
6Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?
7Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?
8Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; your vindicator shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard.
9Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am. If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,
10if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday.
11The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail.
12Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in.

_Second Reading:_  _2 Corinthians 5:20–6:10 (NRSV)_
20...we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
21For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
1As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the grace of God in vain.
2For he says, “At an acceptable time I have listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you.” See, now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation!
3We are putting no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
4but as servants of God we have commended ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,
5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
6by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit, genuine love,
7truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
8in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;
9as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and see—we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed;
10as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.

_Gospel Reading:_  _Matthew 6:1–6, 16-21 (NRSV)_
1“Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.
2“So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
3But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
4so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
5“And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
6But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you...
16“And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
17But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
18so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
19“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal;
20but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.
21For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Sermon

	

Invitation to Observe a Holy Lent
Beloved people of God:
every year at the time of the Christian Passover
we celebrate our redemption
through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Lent is a time to prepare for this celebration
and to renew our life in the paschal mystery.
We begin this holy season
by acknowledging our need for repentance,
and for the mercy and forgiveness
proclaimed in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
We begin our journey to Easter with the sign of ashes.
This ancient sign speaks of the frailty and uncertainty
of human life,
and marks the penitence of this community.
I invite you, therefore, in the name of Christ,
to observe a holy Lent
by self-examination and penitence,
by prayer and fasting,
by works of love,
and by meditating on God’s word.
Now let us bow before God, our creator and redeemer,
and confess our sin.

Psalm 51 (Create in Me A Clean Heart)

Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love;
in your great compassion blot out my offenses.
**Wash me through and through from my wickedness,**
**and cleanse me from my sin.**

Refrain

For I know my offenses,
and my sin is ever before me.
**Against you only have I sinned**
**and done what is evil in your sight;**
**so you are justified when you speak**
**and right in your judgment.**
Indeed, I was born steeped in wickedness,
a sinner from my mother’s womb.
**Indeed, you delight in truth deep within me,**
**and would have me know wisdom deep within.**

Refrain

Remove my sins with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
wash me, and I shall be purer than snow.
**Let me hear joy and gladness;**
**that the body you have broken may rejoice.**

Hide your face from my sins,
and blot out all my wickedness.
**Create in me a clean heart, O God,**
**and renew a right spirit within me.**

Refrain

Cast me not away from your presence,
and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
**Restore to me the joy of your salvation**
**and sustain me with your bountiful Spirit.**
Let me teach your ways to offenders,
and sinners shall be restored to you.
**Rescue me from bloodshed, O God of my salvation,**
**and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness.**

Refrain

O Lord, open my lips,
and my mouth shall declare your praise.
**For you take no delight in sacrifice, or I would give it.**
**You are not pleased with burnt offering.**
**The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit;**
**a troubled and broken heart, O God, you will not despise.**

Refrain

Litany of Penitence
Holy and merciful God,
we confess to you and to one another,
and to the whole communion of saints
in heaven and on earth,
that we have sinned by our own fault
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.

We have not loved you with our whole heart,
and mind, and strength.
We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We have not forgiven others as we have been forgiven.
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

We have not listened to your call to serve as Christ served us.
We have not been true to the mind of Christ.
We have grieved your Holy Spirit.
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

We confess to you, O God, all our past unfaithfulness.
For the pride, hypocrisy, and impatience in our lives,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For our self-indulgent appetites and ways
and our exploitation of other people,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For our anger at our own frustration
and our envy of those more fortunate than ourselves,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For our intemperate love of worldly goods and comforts,
and our dishonesty in daily life and work,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For our negligence in prayer and worship,
and our failure to commend the faith that is in us,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

Accept our repentance, O God,
for the wrongs we have done.
For our neglect of human need and suffering
and our indifference to injustice and cruelty,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For all false judgments,
for uncharitable thoughts toward our neighbors,
and for our prejudice and contempt
toward those who differ from us,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

For our waste and pollution of your creation
and our lack of concern for those who come after us,
And so we pray: **Have mercy on us, O God.**

Restore us, O God of our salvation,
and show us your steadfast love.
**Turn to us in your mercy**
**and redeem us.**

Imposition of Ashes
Almighty God,
you have created us out of the dust of the earth.
May these ashes be for us
a sign of our mortality and penitence,
for it is only by your gracious gift
are we given everlasting life;
through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.

Accomplish in us, O God, the work of your salvation,
**that we may show forth your glory in the world.**

By the cross and passion of our Savior,
**bring us with all your saints**
**to the joy of Christ’s resurrection.**

Hymn: Holiness

Blessing, Charge
May the God of peace
make you holy in every way
and keep your whole being—
spirit, soul, and body—
free from every fault
at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
