- [x] Move back to 2 bread, 2 cup ✅ 2023-11-08

**Gathering**

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Introit: Jesus, Joy of the Highest Heaven

\*Call to Worship 
O God, some of us are discouraged
and long for your embrace.
**Wash us with your love.**
Some of us are weary,
weighed down by the desperation of this world.
**Wash us with your hope.**
Some of us are anxious
and seek refuge from chaotic lives.
**Wash us with your peace.**
Some of us are restless,
yearning for renewal or transformation.
**Wash us with your grace.**
However we come into your presence,
pour out your Spirit upon us.
**Let us come to the waters of baptism.**
**Let us worship God!**

Commentary: As we begin our series on home, we are also reminded that today is the day we consider the baptism of the Lord.  

\*Opening Hymn: I Sought The Lord

\*Prayer of Confession 
**God of grace,**
**You claim us as beloved children and call us**
    **to follow you,**
**but we do not always live out this calling.** 
**We stifle the gifts you have given us**
**rather than using them for your glory.**
**We sidestep opportunities to offer kindness** 
**rather than showing love to our neighbors.** 
**We pretend we can do nothing to further**
    **justice in our world**
**and shy away from taking risks for the sake**
    **of the gospel.**

**Forgive us, Lord.**
**Wash us again in the waters of baptism**
**and transform us by your grace,**
**so that our words may further righteousness**
**and our deeds be pleasing in your sight. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ,** 
**who offers us new life.**

Commentary: Today, in being reminded of Christ’s baptism, we’re also reminded of our own.  At times, we fail to live into its promise.  Yet, God is always and forever graceful to us.

\* Assurance of Pardon

_Adam pours the water here._
Hear the good news!
Hope does not disappoint us,
for God’s love has been poured into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit given to us in Baptism.

Believe this good news and give thanks:
**We are called,**
**We are beloved,**
**We are forgiven.  Amen.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign with one another.

**Word**
Prayer for Illumination
God, in whom we may rest:
Guide our eyes,
    Our hearts,
    Our spirits.
Feed our minds,
    Our hopes,
    Our dreams.
Be with us as we learn. Amen.

Scripture I: **Acts 10:34–43 (NRSV)**
34Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality,
35but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
36You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all.
37That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced:
38how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
39We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;
40but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear,
41not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
42He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead.
43All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”

Scripture II: **John 1:35–41 (NRSV)**
35The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples,
36and as he watched Jesus walk by, he exclaimed, “Look, here is the Lamb of God!”
37The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.
38When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?”
39He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o’clock in the afternoon.
40One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
41He first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated Anointed).

Message: Our Holy Home: The Front Yard

* Signs are everywhere, and in many ways, they welcome us to new locations.
* What are signs?
	* Object, Quality, or event whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.
	* There are two important parts to that:
		* The object, quality, or event
		* And the narrative of it - what happens when you see the sign?
* I wonder how our front yards operate as signs - that tell people what to expect.
	* Boardman, Ohio sign (the front yard of the town)
	* Happy Anniversary sign
	* Not always just signs - a garden in the front yard says one thing versus manicured grass
	* Old Stone Sign
* The question we should ask is what stories might be told by the signs we have in our yards, especially with the church.
	* Maybe our sign looks nice, and we know that it’s inviting, but to the people passing it, the “probable presence or occurrence of something else” might be different than what we think or know.
	* So many of the reasons here in this list are responses to signs.  
		* Some folks remember the churches of their youth, warm, loving
		* Some folks see judgement, hatred, ignorance
* What was Jesus’ front yard?
	* Jesus’ yard was meant to be inviting.  He drew people in.  The signs were pointing to something special.
	* They wanted to know where he was staying - where is your front yard, Jesus?  What is it we’re looking for? 
	* But it was the story he told - before anyone even entered in - before any were disciples - that mattered most.
	* It was of inclusion - “Come and See”.  The sign invited no matter who, no matter what, to come visit.  To come into the house.
* The front yard
	* Our front yards - the initial view of our homes - begin the story, but they can’t end it.
	* They’re the object, the quality, the event, but they’re not the occurrence of something else.
	* In a world so injured by the church, the object, quality, or event may tell of a different probability.
	* So what might we do?  We put in our front yards all the ways we can to invite others to “come and see” - to witness God’s goodness.
	* There are no reservations in the statement - no “come and see” only if.  But just “come and see”.  

Hymn: Softly and Tenderly

Commentary: This simple affirmation is reminds us of who we are, who God is, and what the church is. Direct and to the point, it frames us as we move to the table.

Children’s Time

Commentary: On Communion Sunday, we invite the children to help carry the elements down to the table. In the PCUSA, we invite all who have been baptized to come to the table, regardless of their age. Our Book of Order invites parents to make a decision as to their desire for their children to partake in communion.

Communion

Commentary: We serve communion by intinction. You may come forward and take a piece of bread and dip it in the cup before returning to your seat. If you would like to be given a piece of bread, indicate by cupping your hands and extending them forward.

Prayer After Communion
Bless the Lord, O my soul;
**and all that is within me,**
**bless God’s holy name.**
Bless the Lord, O my soul;
