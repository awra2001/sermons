[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Mark/Mark 1]]


Isaiah 40:1-11
40:1 Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God.
40:2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.
40:3 A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
40:4 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.
40:5 Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
40:6 A voice says, "Cry out!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All people are grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field.
40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are grass.
40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand forever.
40:9 Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear; say to the cities of Judah, "Here is your God!"
40:10 See, the Lord GOD comes with might, and his arm rules for him; his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
40:11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs in his arms, and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead the mother sheep.

Second Reading
Mark 1:1-8
1:1 The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
1:2 As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, "See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way;
1:3 the voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'"
1:4 John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
1:5 And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
1:6 Now John was clothed with camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
1:7 He proclaimed, "The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
1:8 I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."

* Intersection of hope and peace
* We're turning the gem so to speak on hope, and I don't think anyone would mind that we spend a little more time on hope.
* But peace is interesting here.  That's the traditional candle associated with this week. 
* Peace is also a word that has different meaning at times in our context than perhaps outside of it.  Much easier to define peace when it's reference is war, and not our hearts. 
* There is a place where we do talk about peace every week.  Our confession sequence.
	* Every Sunday, we start with together confessing our brokenness.  It's equal parts individual and corporate - we have our things, but as a body we collectively have our things too
	* Then, after a quiet moment, I begin to pour water into the font.  A reminder of the sacrament, and I say a few words about that even though the words we just spoke are true, they don't stop us from being loved and forgiven.   Then I say "in Jesus Christ, we are all forgiven"
	* And then we move to the peace.  I say "the peace of Jesus Christ be with you" you reply, and then we pass peace.  In the early days, it used to be a holy kiss.  We don't do that anymore.
	* It's interesting that this hasn't been a common occurrence.  It only became a part of our worship in the 60s.   But I don't know how this part of the liturgy would work itself out right without it.  There's anticipation of completeness here.  It feels like a meaningful cycle.
		* Without confession I presume there is nothing broken and makes the rest seem unnecessary.
		* Without pardon I'm just left to wallow in my failures without resolve.
		* Without peace I don't reconciliation: that amidst anticipation and hope, that there is a renewal of good relationship. 
* So perhaps, at the intersection of hope and peace comes reconciliation.
	* Mark and Isa
		* Mark is a gospel meant to give you the facts.  Everything's quick, constantly on the move, and Jesus is his most human (contrasted with John, where Jesus is way, way more like God - low Christology vs. high Christology).
		* We hear that this is the anticipatory hope of Isa in the person of John. 
			* And it's our complimentary text today
				* What does that making straight looking like?
				* It's evening out, but it's also what we talked about last week:
					* A recognition that the world isn't what it should be; (we are finite, we're at the mercy of what is around us)
					* A belief that it will be in the end; (God will come)
					* And have the skill and courage to work out anticipation towards hope.  (We shout it from mountain tops)
		* And John does this, but does more than this: he tells us that who is to come is even more than he is - it's not just physical remembrance, but it's going to be a change of the whole self - the Holy Spirit is coming.
	* We hear that same rhythm that we hear in our confession sequence - brokenness, healing, reconciling peace.  What we add on from last week is that the skill and courage to work out anticipation towards hope is a belief of reconciling peace.  Of a baptism of Holy Spirit for all of us.  That who and what is coming is revolutionary.  Powerful.  World shaping.
* What does this mean for us?
	* I don't think in my adult life I can remember a time when reconciliation has been rendered so useless.
		* COVID
		* The election
		* The fighting about whose lives matter
		* And culturally, I'm not sure this is going to get better.  Conceptions of truth and falsehood are more bend towards a narrative that suits us.
			* It's like we don't need to confess brokenness that doesn't exist
			* And don't need to receive a pardon for what is not wrong.
			* And when that happens, well, we're just stuck and unable to see the better.  There's no baptism of water or Holy Spirit.  There is no peace.  There is no reconciliation.  At best it's a sinful detente. 
	* This is, again, what we are good at!  Of holding hope, of anticipating better.  Of true peace and reconcilation and not just a cold war.
	* If we can't work this out here, what hope do we have elsewhere?  If we can't figure out how everyone - and I mean everyone - can be reconciled, then we may as well stop singing "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" because why should we waste the breath?
	* Who do you need to hear the words of reconciliation from?  Who do you need to reconcile with?  All of that could be "myself" or an other.  A concept.  A culture.
	* It's in that movement that perhaps we feel the peace that's always been.  We actually sense the cool water of baptism on us.  In Jesus Christ we are all forgiven.  Amen.
