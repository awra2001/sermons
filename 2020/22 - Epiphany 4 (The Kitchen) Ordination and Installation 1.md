# 2/2 - Epiphany 4 (The Kitchen) [Ordination and Installation]

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship:
As many of you were baptized into Christ
have clothed yourselves with Christ.
**There is one body and one Spirit,**
**just as we were called to the hope of our calling.**

Commentary: These words remind of our calling in varying ways.  Ingredients in the kitchen, ordination and installation - all of us called to do something together.

\* Opening Hymn: 

\* Prayer of Confession

Even when we were dead through sin,
Our merciful and loving God
Made us alive together with Christ
And raised us up through him
In humility and faith
Let us confess our sin to God.

**Mighty and merciful God,**
**you have called us to be your people**
**and claimed us for the service of Jesus Christ.**
**We confess that we have not lived up to our calling.** 
**We have been timid and frightened**
**disciples, forgetful of your powerful presence**
**and the strength of your Spirit among us.**
**O God, forgive our foolish and sinful ways.** 
**As you have chosen us,**
**and claimed us in our baptisms, strengthen us anew**
**to choose Christ’s way in this world.**
**Give us your Holy Spirit**
**that each one in ministry**
**may be provided with all the gifts of grace needed to fulfill our common calling; through Jesus**
**Christ our Lord and Savior.**

Commentary: We are all called, but yet we can be fearful of that calling.  Yet there is grace in our gifts.

\* Assurance of Pardon
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Children’s Time 

Chorus: 

Prayer for Illumination: 

First Reading:  1 Corinthians 12:14–31 (NRSV)
14Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many.
15If the foot would say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
16And if the ear would say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
17If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
18But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.
19If all were a single member, where would the body be?
20As it is, there are many members, yet one body.
21The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
22On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
23and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect;
24whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member,
25that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.
26If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.
27Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
28And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues.
29Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
30Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
31But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.

Second Reading:  John 6:35–40 (NRSV)
35Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
36But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.
37Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away;
38for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
39And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.
40This is indeed the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will raise them up on the last day.”

Message: Our Holy Home: The Kitchen

	Good homemade bread is equal parts simple and complicated
	
	One level it’s just basically tossing together some dry ingredients with some oil and water, getting some rise, and then baking it off.
	
	But, you start looking at the component parts, it isn’t just that simple.
	
	I think about yeast a lot.
		Right before we left for seminary, we went to a day in Bexley featuring how to care for chickens at home, as well as how to have sourdough
		
		The person who taught us about sourdough bread also offered to give us some of her starter. 
		
		You had to treat it like a pet.  It needed fed, let out, but if you did take care of it, it would return love.  Typically in the form of bagels, focaccia, and delicious crusty bread that could be shaped in so many ways.
		
		My first starter lasted 4 years.  I had freeze dried some to make the trip to and from Austin, but ran out of it before coming back.
		
		The longest one I know about is something like 122 years.  Generations of maintenance!
		
	Aren’t we the Bread of Life?
		While Jesus himself declared himself the bread of life, as Christians who want to be like Christ, it’s not a far stretch to consider how we too, could be bread of life.
		
		What Jesus says here is what we hope for those who enter our doors - that they are not hungry or thirsty.  And that can be literal, but it’s also spiritual.  
		
		But, even Jesus recognized that it isn’t necessarily his will that is done on the earth, but rather it’s God who is calling the shots, Jesus fulfills the task.
		
	Maybe we’re more the yeast then.
		Probably more accurate.  The yeast are one of the most defining parts of bread but they have no will in the preparation of the bread of life.  They are poured out for their task.  Without them, the bread is flat, listless, hardly more than a stale cracker.  Certainly not able to be transformed to whatever the Baker needs.
		
		However, that seems rather sad if our perception of yeast only settles on something like we get in the store.  Freeze dried and suspended, it only comes to life for a brief moment and then is done.  Plenty of church can seem like this.  
		
		But that isn’t the way a starter works.  Instead, the starter is always being fed, it’s always producing more, and from the excess of the starter comes the bread, the bagel, the focaccia.  And given enough to be fed, a starter can last decades.  Even partially neglected, it can hold its own in a slowed state in the fridge.  But it’s at its best when its out doing, being, producing, and pouring itself out for the world.
		
	This seem particularly appropriate on an instillation Sunday.
		Today we take time out to recognize our leadership, to place them into their positions, and see them help provide the leavening for this church and the community. 
		
		But it’s not the same if it isn’t fed.  If it isn’t part of a larger whole that pushes it on, invites it to go forward.  Because none of the folks in leadership today are different than anyone who isn’t.  We’ve just been asked to be set apart for particular tasks, much like the yeast in the bread.
		
		And when we’re at our best, we’re not in some slowed state, but instead we’re constantly feeding ourselves, growing, and excited for what the Baker may call us to do.
		

\* Hymn: 

_Installation and Ordination_

As many of you as were baptized into Christ
Have clothed yourself with Christ.
**There is one body and one Spirit,**
**Just as we were called to the one hope of our calling.**
In baptism, all of those you see before you were clothed with Christ,
and are now called by God through the voice of the church to enter into ministries of service and governance, announcing in word and deed the good news of Jesus Christ.
**We remember with joy our common calling to serve Christ,**
**and we celebrate God’s particular call to our brothers and sisters.**

We are all called into the church of Jesus Christ by baptism, and marked as Christ’s own by the Holy Spirit.

This is our common calling, to be disciples and servants of our servant Lord. 

Within the community of the church, some are called to particular service as deacons, as elders, as trustees, and as ministers as Teaching Elders.
Ordination is Christ’s gift to the church, assuring that his ministry continues among us, providing for ministries of caring and compassion in the world, ordering the governance of the church, and preaching the Word and administering the sacraments.

**(Tracy)**
Mister Moderator:  Speaking for the people of the church, I bring **Brian Bucher** to be ordained and installed as Elder**,** and **Becky Kruger and Greg Menssen** to be installed as Elder.

I bring **Kip Kreuger, Yolanda Terry, and BarBara Mobley** to be installed as Deacons.

I bring**, Dan Roshon,** **Tena Sansom, and Bill Allen** to be recognized as Trustee.

**Those who are to be ordained, installed and recognized gather at the baptismal font.**

**The minister continues…**

For all present, those who are to be ordained and those who will be installed. Let us reaffirm our baptismal vows, renouncing all that oppose God and God’s rule and affirming the faith of the holy catholic church.

Trusting in the gracious mercy of God, do you turn from the ways of sin and renounce evil and its power in the world?

**I do.**

Do you turn to Jesus Christ and accept him as your Lord and Savior, trusting in his grace and love?

**I do.**

Will you be Christ’s faithful disciple, obeying his Word and showing his love?

**I will, with God’s help.**

**(For those to be ordained and installed only)**
**Brian** God has called you by the voice of the church to serve Jesus Christ in a special way.  You know who we are and what we believe and you understand the work for which you have been chosen.

Do you trust in Jesus Christ your Savior, acknowledge him Lord of the world and head of the church, and through him believe in one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?  _**I do**__._

Do you accept the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be, by the Holy Spirit, the unique and authoritative witness to Jesus Christ in the church universal, and God’s word to you? _**I do.**_

Will you be instructed by the Confessions of our church, and led by them as you lead the people of God?  _**I will.**_

Will you be Elders in obedience to Jesus Christ, under the authority of Scripture, and continually guided by our Confessions?  _**I will.**_

Do you endorse our church’s government, and will you honor its discipline?  Will you be a friend among your comrades in ministry, working with them, subject to the ordering of God’s word and Spirit?  _**I do and I will**__._

Will you govern the way you live, by following the Lord Jesus Christ, loving neighbors, and working for the reconciliation of the world?  _**I will.**_

Will you seek to serve the people with energy, intelligence, imagination, and love?  _**I will.**_

_**To the Elders…**_ 
**Brian, Becky** and **Greg** will you be a faithful elder, watching over the people, providing for their worship and instruction?  Will you share in government and discipline, serving in courts of the church; and, in your ministry, will you try to show the love and justice of Jesus Christ?  _**I will.**_

_**To the Deacons…**_
**Kip, Yolanda, and Barb,** will you be a faithful deacon, teaching charity, urging concern, and directing the peoples’ help to the friendless and those in need?  In your ministry, will you try to show the love and justice of Jesus Christ?  _**I will.**_

**(Tracy)**
_**To the Trustees…**_
**Dan, Tena, and Bill** God has given you special gifts to serve him, and we have chosen you for a special work.  Under the law of the state, you will hold and manage properties and, as authorized, conduct business for the church.  By your energy, honesty, and fairness, you will demonstrate Christian faith to those you deal with on our behalf.”  In so doing, will you seek to serve the people with energy, intelligence, imagination, and love?  Will you, like good stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve this congregation with whatever gift each of you has received. 
_**I will.**_

“Let us pray: Holy God, you made this world and called it good, and appointed us to manage things as agents of your love.  Guide your servants as they represent us, and direct our business.  Help them to be wise children of light, who show your trust by being trustworthy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”

_**(To the Trustee)**_
“You are now trustee for this church.  Be good and faithful servants, who will enter into the joy of our Lord.  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.” 
_**Trustee may sit in the front row**_

**(Tracy)**
**Becky** and **Greg** having been elected again to active service by the vote of this congregation to the position of Elder, **Yolanda, Kip, and Barb** having been elected again to active service by the vote of this congregation to the position of Deacon, may now be installed to office.

**(Adam)**
  Do you welcome the work for which you have been chosen, and will you serve the people with energy, intelligence, imagination, and love, relying on God’s mercy and rejoicing in his promises through Jesus Christ our Lord?  **I do and I will.**

**(Tracy)** _**\- Addressing the Congregation**_
Do we, the members of the church accept **Brian, Greg** and  **Brecky** as **Elders****; Kip, Yolanda, and Barb** as a **Deacon;** and **Bill, Dan, and Tena** as a trustee chosen by God through the voice of this congregation to lead us in the way of Jesus Christ?   
**We do.**

Do we agree to encourage **them**, to respect **their** decisions, and to follow as **they** guide us, serving Jesus Christ, who alone is Head of the Church?   **We do.**

**Prayer and Laying on of Hands    (Adam)**
_**Brian may kneel at this point in the service**_
Let us pray:  **(kneel)**

**Elders** _**(previously ordained elders invited for laying on of hands**__)_

Almighty God, in every age you have chosen servants to speak your word and lead your loyal people.  We thank you for **Brian** whom you have called to serve you.  Give **him** special gifts to do **his** special work; and fill **him** with the Holy Spirit, so **he** may have the same mind that was in Christ Jesus, and be **faithful disciple** as long as **he** shall live.

**Brian** you are now **Elder** in the Presbyterian Church (USA) and for this congregation.  Whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.  Amen.

_**Welcome to this ministry**_.

**Prayer**
God of grace, who called us to a common ministry as ambassadors of Christ, trusting us with the message of reconciliation: give us courage and discipline to follow where your servants rightly lead us; that together we may declare your wonderful deeds and show your love to the world; through Jesus Christ the Lord of all.  Amen.
