# 2/16 - Epiphany 6 (The Bedroom)

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship:
Gracious God, we take rest:
**Hopeful for restoration, renewal, and comfort.**
Gracious God, we take rest:
**Dreaming of right relationship and holy community.**
Gracious God, we take rest:
**Let us worship the God of the Sabbath!  Amen.**

Commentary: As we think about our bedrooms, we think about all the ways we seek Sabbath rest.

\* Opening Hymn: Your Great Name

\* Prayer of Confession
**God of the quiet,**
**We are a busy people.**
**Often moving from one place to the other,**
**Hardly remembering when we had slept enough,**
**Rested enough,**
**Or found all the comfort we need.**
**We are not infinite, not** **infallible, not full of endless energy.**

**Help us, O infinite, perfect, boundless God,**
**Be so bold to rest, as you, too have rested.**

Commentary: In a society that demands so much of us, constantly desiring us to go and do, we are made to believe that rest is a secondary option, and that our identities somehow are reduced if we rest.  Yet the One who created everything took rest after completing the work at hand.  What may stop us from seeing our work completed for the time, and seeking rest? 

\* Assurance of Pardon
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Children’s Time 

Chorus: God Welcomes All

Prayer for Illumination: 
Gracious God,
Help us see,
Help us learn,
Help us know,
Help us believe.
Amen.

First Reading:  Genesis 1:27–2:3 (NRSV)
27So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
28God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.”
29God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
30And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
31God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
1Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
2And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
3So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.

Second Reading:  Luke 5:12–16 (NRSV)
12Once, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean.”
13Then Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, “I do choose. Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him.
14And he ordered him to tell no one. “Go,” he said, “and show yourself to the priest, and, as Moses commanded, make an offering for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.”
15But now more than ever the word about Jesus spread abroad; many crowds would gather to hear him and to be cured of their diseases.
16But he would withdraw to deserted places and pray.

Message: Our Holy Home: The Bedroom 

	Our need for rest is one of the topics we talk a lot about, but don’t really talk about.
	
	As a society, we tend to be one of the most overworked of developed societies, but over time get less and less sleep. (40% of us don’t get enough)\[fitbit slides\]
	
	But it’s not just work, it’s all the other things that demand our time.  So how do we truly rest?
		Sometimes it’s just ignoring it and soldering on - I’ll sleep when I’m dead
		
		Sometimes the option is self-care.  \[slide\]
		
		Our texts help us think about good rest.
		
	SCRIPTURE
		We are made for it.
			Genesis reminds us first that we are made to rest.  If we are in the image of God, and God rests, then we should probably rest, too.
			
			How even more so as finite bodies that we are made for a time of resting?
			
		There is a sense of completeness of the task.
			God witnessed all that was created, and said “this is real good!"
				The word is interesting because it takes all sorts of different shapes in Hebrew  - good, merry, pleasant, desirable, in order, usable, efficient, friendly, kind, morally good
				
				God had done work, witnessed how it was good, desirable, in order, morally good, and enjoyed rest.
				
			Jesus as well has a sense of completeness.  He heals, it’s done, he’s celebrated, and he retreats.
			
		The rest directs itself outwards.
			Jesus doesn’t necessarily have a spa day.
			
			He goes to stripped away places - the desolate places that often are referenced in the NT to describe where John comes from, where the Israelite’s wandered - it’s a place of miracle.  
			
			It’s place where life is more thin (less chaotic, less driven by what’s going on around us - away from the crowds)
			
			And he meets with God.  And after his time, he goes back to healing.
			
	What does this mean for us?
		We can’t avoid rest.  Or, it will come for us in ways we won’t want. The kids when they’re tired, and it just continues.
		
		Nor can it just be a self-indulgence, as our society wants to bend towards, because our empty selves are too shallow of a well to draw from.
		
		Instead, what might it be like to find something that invites the completeness of tasks already completed, and moving outwards.
			Yes, sometimes it can be the wilderness to withdraw.
			
			But what if there’s something else?  Something that celebrates the good and very good, and is outward focused?
			
	ACTIVITY
		On the back of the bulletin there’s some blank space.
		
		Write the response to this question: What’s the one thing you enjoy so much that if you had the chance you would teach it?
		
		I love watching eyes light up when we do this activity, because it speaks to something different about Sabbath rest - that it can be something restorative - it is the heart of who we are.
		
		What if we were the type of church that offered the opportunity to teach these things?  Where are people who want a chance to just learn?
		
		Are you interested in really teaching this?  Write your name and put it in a basket or the offering plate.
