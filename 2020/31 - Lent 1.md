# 3/1 - Lent 1

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship: 
God of our past, who created us in Your image, good and very good.
**Let us to worship You!**
God of our present, who binds us in Your community, good and very good.
**Let us to worship You!**
God of our future, who restores us in Your mercy, good and very good.
**Let us to worship You!**
**God of all time, who cares for us in Your love, good and very good.**
**Let us worship you!**

Commentary:  As we begin our light journey into Lent, we are reminded of what is sure - a God who has been with us without fail, a community of faith that comes with us, and the promise of grace and love from all.  

\* Opening Hymn:  For All You’ve Done 
Commentary: 

\* Prayer of Confession
_Friends__, in our journey, God is with us, and always willing to hear us when we cry for grace.  Let us then_ _approach_ _God with our corporate confessions, saying:_

**Gracious God,**
**Forgive us for the things we’ve done,**
**And the things we’ve left undone:**
**The ways we’ve ignored the needs of the lonely,**
**And not put a hand out to the forgotten.**

**Remind us, God, in this Lenten season,**
**You made us to not be alone,**
**But to be in community: each one, part of the whole.**

Commentary:  For Lent, we will hear the beginning of a familiar confession - asking for forgiveness for both the sins of commission (what we’ve done), and omission (what’s left undone).  We don’t always think of the specifics.  Just like in Ash Wednesday, though we should reflect on our humanness - broken, sinful - we also should consider what our human response could be. 

\* Assurance of Pardon
_Hear the waters of baptism, the sounds of our forgiveness._
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Special Music: Where I Belong

Commentary: As Christians, we are ultimately made for a world beyond this one, but we recognize that, as we journey here in this life, we don't abdicate our call to love and serve but rather do so in response to our eternal gift of grace. So the song is about living both for this world and the next at once, a tricky thing maybe.

Children’s Time 

Chorus: God Welcomes All

Prayer for Illumination: 
God who guides,
Christ who leads,
Spirit who connects,
Guide us in your Word,
Speak to our hearts,
Lead us to grace.
Amen.

Reading:  Hebrews 12:1–3 (NRSV)
1Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
2looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.
3Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.

Message: Becoming an Ancestor (Rev. Landon J. Adams)

\* Hymn: Come Thou Font

Commentary: 

\* Affirmation of Faith:

**We believe in God, Creator and Creating;**
**who gives us steadfast love, and shares with us our joy,**
**and sustains us in our suffering.**
**We trust in God’s power in the world.**

**We follow Jesus Christ, fully God, fully human.**
**In death was victory, in resurrection was hope;**
**in him the Word became flesh; in him we are offered**
**forgiveness from sin, renewal from failure, reconciliation**
**from brokenness, release from despair.**

**We are guided by the Holy Spirit, God’s presence in the world.**

**By the Spirit we are called into the Church,**
**to celebrate love, seek justice and resist evil,**
**to proclaim Jesus, crucified and risen,**
**to share with Christ’s Baptism and to eat at Christ’s Table.**

**Because we are God’s disciples, a pilgrim people,**
**we joyfully covenant with each other to walk together in love,**
**pray for one another, care for one another,**
**And live in holy community, in life, in death, in life beyond death.**

**God is with us. We are not alone. Thanks be to God.**

Prayers of the People

The Lord’s Prayer

Offering

Doxology

\* Hymn - Guide My Feet

Commentary: What better words for our Lenten journey than this plain-spoken spiritual.

\* Charge and Benediction 

\* Postlude

Closing Commentary:  On Ash Wednesday, these words were spoken:

I invite you, therefore, in the name of Christ,
to observe a holy Lent
by self-examination and penitence,
by prayer and fasting,
by works of love,
and by meditating on God’s word.

Our hope is that throughout Lent, we can focus on these practices as the means by which we take our light journey.  However, this is not just an individual exercise.  It’s only in community - beside each other and with God - can we truly engage on our journey.
