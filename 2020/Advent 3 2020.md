Isaiah 61:1-4, 8-11
61:1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners;
61:2 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
61:3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion-- to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. They will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, to display his glory.
61:4 They shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.
61:8 For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
61:9 Their descendants shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge that they are a people whom the LORD has blessed.
61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
61:11 For as the earth brings forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.

John 1:6-8, 19-28
1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
1:7 He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.
1:8 He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light.
1:19 This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
1:20 He confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, "I am not the Messiah."
1:21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."
1:22 Then they said to him, "Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
1:23 He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,'" as the prophet Isaiah said.
1:24 Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
1:25 They asked him, "Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"
1:26 John answered them, "I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not know,
1:27 the one who is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal."
1:28 This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing.

* Anticipation and hope; hope and peace; trust and joy
	* Think about my kids and their unabashed laughs
	* When Abe would start just roar when I would make quick breaths through my nose, Frankie and her "hi baby" routine
	* They just laughed without any concern about anything us but what was bringing them their joy
	* But, of course, they don't just always laugh... and that's the thing.  Children's emotions seem more free, especially compared to an adults.
	* I wonder if that's because there's trust there.  I know it's not the same for every child or every childhood, but our ideal would be that children experience the full range of emotions trusting it's safe, and because they can trust in that safety, it brings them more joy.
	* Trust and joy build each other up.
* This Sunday, Gaudette Sunday, is meant to be the Sunday we celebrate joy.
	* But joy can be fleeting.  The Crew won last night.  I was elated.  I still am.  But that won't carry me to my grave.
	* M Volf: \[Joy is\] the emotional dimension of the good life, of a life that is both going well and is being lived well.
		* Which means sometimes it can not be going well, and might not be lived well.
		* There has to be a well that we can draw from.  And here, in this Sunday, we're offered trust as a well.
* Isa: Trust in the present and future joy
	* This time is Isa is when the people return from exile.  Their lands were devastated, they were torn from them, and then...
	* The prophet was called to bring joy to the joyless (poor - better understood as "a state of wretchedness")
	* And was giving freedom to those who were bound (interesting to note both captives and prisoners - imprisonment from the outside and from their own deeds)
	* They're provisioned.  They have what they need to be joyful.
	* And that there if future joy to be had.
* Jn - hearing the story again
	* John leads us to believe that the Baptist was always part of the plan.
	* The baptist trusted too - there's someone to come... someone who, again, will change the world.  Who when he announces his ministry, will unroll the scroll, find our Isa 61, and say he is that prophet.
* If joy really is what Volf gives us - then the way we build the joy is to provision for life going well, and life lived well.
	* Going well - justice (freedom from captives)
	* Lived well - piety? (freedom from prisons)
	* And when we trust that this place, our community, can provision those things, then our foundation is secured.
	* And when that foundation is secured, we can be the one proclaiming - we have a space in which to be free to love the full range of what life offers us.
