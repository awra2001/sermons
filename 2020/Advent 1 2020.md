[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Isaiah/Isa 64]]
[[_Resources/Bible/MSG/Mark/Mark 13]]


Isaiah 64:1-9
64:1 O that you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence--
64:2 as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble at your presence!
64:3 When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
64:4 From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.
64:5 You meet those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways. But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we transgressed.
64:6 We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
64:7 There is no one who calls on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.
64:8 Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
64:9 Do not be exceedingly angry, O LORD, and do not remember iniquity forever. Now consider, we are all your people.

Mark 13:24-37
13:24 "But in those days, after that suffering, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
13:25 and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
13:26 Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' with great power and glory.
13:27 Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
13:28 "From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
13:29 So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates.
13:30 Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.
13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
13:32 "But about that day or hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
13:33 Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come.
13:34 It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.
13:35 Therefore, keep awake--for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn,
13:36 or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly.
13:37 And what I say to you I say to all: Keep awake."

* Advent is the start of our preparation.  We're getting ready for what is to come.
* There are these two words that are working through the service today - anticipation and hope. 
* How do we manage anticipation and hope together? 
	* It starts with a small scale in the middle of a bedroom, in its annual ritual: forlorn until the first of the year, then the center of attention for a fleeting moment, until it is left to be abandoned again.  Oh to be a scale.
	* Or any of the other top 10 New Year's Resolutions:
		* Enjoy Life
		* Spend Less, Save More
		* Spend more time with loved ones
		* Get organized
		* Learn a new hobby/language
		* Travel More
		* Read More
	* Why do we continue to do these?  Because I think we live a life that goes from anticipation to hope.
		* Anticipation
			* The act of regarding as probable; advance action
			* Anticipation recognizes that there is a future state, and we might work towards steps to get to a future state.
			* We all anticipate.  The question is what space does our anticipation lie in?
		* Hope
			* Hope is the belief that in that future space, good things will happen.
			* It's the reason we get on our scales, we go exercise, we read, or spend time with family more - all those are recognition of a better future state.  I know my spare tire isn't exactly the best I could be.  I know there is something more, and so I work
		* Of course these aren't always just a given
			* The anaesthetising allure of inertia - I can always start tomorrow.  Anticipation involves action towards the future state, but when we go nowhere, anticipation and hope stay a comforting abstraction.  Some of that is just human nature, some of that is fear of failure - the good thing won't come about.  Too much of that leads to
			* Despair - the opposite of hope.  These are the sullen no resolution folks: I don't do it because I won't. 
		* However, this interplay of anticipation and hope build upon themselves - every pound, every new sentence learned gets you to where you believe the future state will be.  Even in failure, it can be iterative - it's about taking the steps towards what we hope for, not what we despair towards.
	* The text shows us how these play together
		* Isa - you did these amazing things and we responded!  Then things got quiet and we got caught in our inertia, but we know change is gonna come.  Anticipation + hope.
		* Mk - "keep awake" could be as much "anticipate" as anything.  But what we do with it is whether we lead into hope or despair - when the master returns, what will they find?
* What about for us?
	* I think we can live into the early part of the Mark passage - that this was all supposed to happen already.  It makes despair so much easier.  It makes hope seem foolish. 
	* But we as Christians, if we are invited to do anything, is to be the caretakers of a hopeful anticipation.
		* A recognition that the world isn't what it should be;
		* A belief that it will be in the end;
		* And have the skill and courage to work out anticipation towards hope.  We keep awake.  We maintain.  We steward.
	* In our time for the work of the people, I invite you to think about that.  Let me know.  Use the cards.  Leave something on the Facebook page under the sermon this afternoon.
