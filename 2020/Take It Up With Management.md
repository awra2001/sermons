# Take It Up With Management

**Exodus 16:2-15**
16:2 The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
16:3 The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not.
16:5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days."
16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
16:7 and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaining against the LORD. For what are we, that you complain against us?"
16:8 And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the LORD has heard the complaining that you utter against him--what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the LORD."
16:9 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, 'Draw near to the LORD, for he has heard your complaining.'"
16:10 And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
16:11 The LORD spoke to Moses and said,
16:12 "I have heard the complaining of the Israelites; say to them, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
16:13 In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
16:14 When the layer of dew lifted, there on the surface of the wilderness was a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground.
16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.

**Matthew 20:1-16**
20:1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
20:2 After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard.
20:3 When he went out about nine o'clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace;
20:4 and he said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' So they went.
20:5 When he went out again about noon and about three o'clock, he did the same.
20:6 And about five o'clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?'
20:7 They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.'
20:8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first.'
20:9 When those hired about five o'clock came, each of them received the usual daily wage.
20:10 Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage.
20:11 And when they received it, they grumbled against the landowner,
20:12 saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.'
20:13 But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?
20:14 Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you.
20:15 Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?'
20:16 So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”

* This has become a bit of a joke now over the last few years - people who feel really strongly need to talk to the manager
* At times, it’s totally appropriate, but others, you question the motives.
* And what’s worse is when the person who gets yelled at first is the one that has the least control over what’s going on (the cashier) - it’s as though it’s less about the result of the complaint and more about the act of it.  It feels a little better if we get a chance to let off some steam with someone who can’t do anything about it, and then seek our satisfaction elsewhere.
* What is it that draws that kind of emotions up in us?
	* Exodus: It seems to be some knowledge of what was had.  
		* Fleshpots and eating fill of bread.  At least when we were slaves and killed by the Egyptians, at least we knew.  At least we had control.  But this - this we don’t know.
		* We don’t know what’s going to happen.  We fear scarcity.  
		* So they complain - they grumble.  And they complain to the cashiers of Moses and Aaron apparently.  
		* The truth ended up being however that the complaining was moot.  God heard, and God provided.  
		* God provides abundance to the beloved people.
	* Matthew
		* Matthew’s workers issue seems to be about scarity as well.
		* We all only have so much time to give, and so we want to be compensated for it.
		* And so the owner of the vineyard heads out every few hours and gathers some more folks to go work, with already the full intention of paying everyone equally whether or not they worked 8 or 1 hour.  I might be upset too, given our current system, if I found out someone got paid the same amount for 1/8th the work.
		* However, the owner’s response is one of abundance as well.  That there’s no need to index giving based on what work is performed, but instead, that all are given to generously.  One’s worth is irrespective of what value they are to the owner.
* Perhaps then, our complaints and our frustrations are because we believe far too easily in scarity.  That there isn’t enough, and we must hoard what’s ours.
* We can take it up with the cashiers, but they can’t do much.  They are often themselves just as stuck in a system of scarcity as we are.
* Instead, we need to take it up with the manager.  
	* The manager is capable of hearing our complaints. 
	* But we shouldn’t be surprised when the manager points out our scarcity and invites us into abundance.
* The current and future moment.
	* The tendency now is to believe that everything is scarce, and it feels that way.
	* Not going to spend the whole month talking about departure, but that will be the same tendency, to feel like losing a pastor leads to scarcity.
	* Don’t give into the grumbling and complaining of the feelings that there isn’t enough.  God will always provide.
	* It may not look like what we want - it may be dust on the ground, or may be given in ways we’re not excited about, but God will provide.
