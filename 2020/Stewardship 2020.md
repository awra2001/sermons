# Stewardship 2020

**Luke 18:1-8**
18:1 Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart.
18:2 He said, "In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people.
18:3 In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, 'Grant me justice against my opponent.'
18:4 For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, 'Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone,
18:5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.'"
18:6 And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
18:7 And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?
18:8 I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”

* Hard mode - starting mid-pandemic after election.  Expert mode - doing a stewardship sermon week 2.
* But this might be a chance to learn what I think about stewardship, which often is an unasked question until it sneaks up on us.
	* Stewardship is about caretaking of a story.
	* Even if we are folks who tithe consistently without any other conversation are living into a story of dedication.
	* When our story was mostly everyone's story, we might have taken it for granted.  But that's not overtly the case today.
* The text today is one of my favorites as it pertains to telling a story.
	* The widow: would be alone, without a whole lot of power in society
	* The judge: is the opposite of the great commandment in a position of power.  
	* The widow shows up, and shows up, and shows up.  Indefinite time
	* And the judge finally changes his mind.  Why?
		* “She’s causing me trouble."
		* “Wear me out”: exhaust someone, imagined as a punch in the eye. 
* What story can be so convicting that it causes someone completely out of power to overwhelm someone who has all the power the world?
	* One that is told over and over again
		* Sometimes this is titled "widow and the unjust judge," but I prefer "the parable of the persistent widow."  It's less about the judge.
		* There isn't a determinate time here in the text
		* 10 times? 100 times?  1000 times?  We don't know. 
		* In already here and not yet, there can be some space between “thy Kingdom come” and “every knee will bow and every tongue confess."
	* Which is persuasive _because_ it's told over and over.
		* The judge was not convinced of anything but his own self-preservation, and yet justice happened.
		* We shouldn’t discount this as an illegitimate approach to serving in the kingdom.  It's not sexy, it's not something you throw up on a sign in front of the church, but it is the foundation that sustains the explosive exciting moments.  Justice grinds.  The stewardship of that story grinds.
		* Sometimes the judges in our hearts, in our neighborhoods, in our culture will be persuaded because we keep showing up.  It may be time 1001 that matters. 
	* And one that leads towards hope - _even_ when we tell it over and over.
		* We don't know anything more here than "grant me justice."  But it's demand, not hedge, tells of hope.
		* A story that can be hopeful time 10, time 100, time 1000 is one that sustains.  Upends the world.  One worth throwing ourselves behind.
* What is our story?
	* It's one around this time 107 years ago with 24 members.  Not 1700.  24.
	* It's one that started 5 years before global pandemic that affected a third of the world's population.  And they kept going.
	* It's a church where the bank that held the Women of the Church failed.  And they kept going.
	* It's a church saying "when world conditions permit our beautiful church edifice will be erected on this site...".  And they kept going.
	* Of pastors putting shovels to ground.  And they kept going.
	* It's a story of life.  Of overcoming obstacles to be a beacon.
	* Stewardship in 2020, and beyond, is stubbornly telling this story to whatever judge might be in the way.
		* Judges who proclaim death.
		* Judges of fear.
		* And they may be in our hearts.  So let's be relentless in telling and believing our story.
* Practical?
	* We'll keep explaining that to you.  But, my encouragement is give what you have, and try to do just a little more.
	* A one dollar a week pledge is as much about believing a story of hope, especially if you haven't before.
	* Offering your gifts - even if times you weren't encouraged in the past - is believing this story of hope.
