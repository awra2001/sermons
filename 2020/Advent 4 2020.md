# Advent 4 2020

Psalm 89:1-4, 19-26
89:1 I will sing of your steadfast love, O LORD, forever; with my mouth I will proclaim your faithfulness to all generations.
89:2 I declare that your steadfast love is established forever; your faithfulness is as firm as the heavens.
89:3 You said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to my servant David:
89:4 'I will establish your descendants forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah
89:19 Then you spoke in a vision to your faithful one, and said: "I have set the crown on one who is mighty, I have exalted one chosen from the people.
89:20 I have found my servant David; with my holy oil I have anointed him;
89:21 my hand shall always remain with him; my arm also shall strengthen him.
89:22 The enemy shall not outwit him, the wicked shall not humble him.
89:23 I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him.
89:24 My faithfulness and steadfast love shall be with him; and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
89:25 I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.
89:26 He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation!'

Luke 1:26-38
1:26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
1:27 to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
1:28 And he came to her and said, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you."
1:29 But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
1:30 The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
1:31 And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.
1:32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David.
1:33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."
1:34 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
1:35 The angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.
1:36 And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.
1:37 For nothing will be impossible with God."
1:38 Then Mary said, "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word." Then the angel departed from her.
...
1:46b "My soul magnifies the Lord,
1:47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
1:48 for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
1:49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
1:50 His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.
1:51 He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
1:52 He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;
1:53 he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.
1:54 He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,
1:55 according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever."

Hope+Anticipation; Hope+Peace; Joy+Trust; Love+Delight

* The touchdown moment
	* You've been flying for awhile, and you're not quite in the terminal
	* From touchdown to final taxi, it's an infinite moment
	* We all do different things to fidget during that time
	* However, I've tried in the last few flights to really think through all that's happened to get me to this fidgety moment
		* Millions of folks and their labor
		* The harnessing of the atmosphere
		* The architectural marvel of facilities
		* All this for my few hundred dollars.
	* The more I think on that, the more that infinite moments has infinite things to celebrate, things to delight in.
* Delight and love
	* Delight is a deep joy or pleasure in what is.
	* Hard to delight in the future
	* Our present delight might build, however, on the past as it helps us celebrate the present.
	* It's the first bite of a dessert, or the moment you walk into your new house after saving to buy for it.
	* The first view of the child.  It's not anticipatory, it just is in that moment.  The delight of it
	* And that delight opens up an infinite sea of love.  That delight in the present moment changes lenses.
	* Mary delights in the moment, and she can celebrate all of what God has done and will continue to do.  God's love is put on display because of this delighting moment.
* Avoiding delight
	* It's not hard, though, to miss delight and love in the present
		* After all, what if Mary said no?  It's an interesting though exercise
			* I'm sure Jesus would have been born still
			* But would Mary have missed out on delighting in the moment?  To see God's love and steadfastness?
		* Abe and wanting to spend his money
			* Easy for me to say "well, he needs to save some, it's foolish to give it all away"
			* Had a done that, I would have missed his heart, would have missed his desire to love others
		* PJ Day
			* Was a clerical error
			* But what is it to delight in the safety, vulnerability, and comfort people feel?
* Without seeking the delight in the moment, we becomes victims of continuous transgressions.  We collapse under a feeling that God might not be there, when God may be in the infinite moments that we justify through fidgeting to the next.
	* This may be one of the fundamental values of Advent for us.  That we can't just get off the plane in November and jump to Christmas.  That it requires us to anticipate.  But in our anticipation, we find an unspeakable amount of opportunities to delight in what's now.
	* Turn to consecration Sunday as well.  Our gifts and pledges could be delight as well.
