# Bending the grief curve

**Jeremiah 15:15-21**
15:15 O LORD, you know; remember me and visit me, and bring down retribution for me on my persecutors. In your forbearance do not take me away; know that on your account I suffer insult.
15:16 Your words were found, and I ate them, and your words became to me a joy and the delight of my heart; for I am called by your name, O LORD, God of hosts.
15:17 I did not sit in the company of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice; under the weight of your hand I sat alone, for you had filled me with indignation.
15:18 Why is my pain unceasing, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Truly, you are to me like a deceitful brook, like waters that fail
15:19 Therefore thus says the LORD: If you turn back, I will take you back, and you shall stand before me. If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, you shall serve as my mouth. It is they who will turn to you, not you who will turn to them.
15:20 And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you, but they shall not prevail over you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you, says the LORD.
15:21 I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.

**Matthew 16:21-28**
16:21 From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
16:22 And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you."
16:23 But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things."
16:24 Then Jesus told his disciples, "If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
16:25 For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.
16:26 For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?
16:27 "For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done.
16:28 Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."

* Of everything this week, the part that struck me most was Jer 15:18
	* Why has my pain become endless, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?  You really are become for me, as it were, a deception - untrustworthy waters.
		* That pain is the type that we’re trying to avoid.  It’s the pain that caused Job’s friends to sit with him for days in his grief, and at the point it’s not letting Jer go.
		* He mentions this twice - that’s typically for emphasis.
		* And the you here is God.  Jer is accusing God of being a mirage.  God’s supposed to be this wellspring of life, and God isn’t.
* Jesus doesn’t paint much better a picture.
	* This isn’t just for him, but it’s for all the disciples.  
	* And there’s admittedly probably some self-preservation here on Peter’s part, and Jesus wants none of it.
	* In order to do the thing he’s called to do, it’s going to come at a cost.  He realizes it.
* What does it mean to deal with he world when we won’t be conformed to it?
	* This comes even more to mind this week, amidst so much pain this week.  A hurricane in the south, Jacob Blake paralyzed with his three children in the car, two more people dead from protests and riots.
	* Carlos story.
	* This was just a small way, insignificant and fleeting.  I was a tourist in the pain of a black man I love.
* To not be conformed to this world is to recognize as the people of God we have to sit through the pain.  That there are wounds that won’t heal.  We can cover over them, but they’ll stay.
	* To sit through the pain of so many right now is part of what we do
	* To bring our own pains and wounds and invite others to share in them - that’s our prayers of the people.  
* It means perhaps not running from the pain, but having to be in it at times.  And that pain may cause us to feel a distance from God.
* However, the promise in both passages is that there is redemption on the other side.
* God does promise that things will get better, and while Jesus promises a return, we don’t know when the next one is.  So we sit here.
* As people of faith, we need to sit with the Carlos’ and Jacob Blakes, because we know that is a wound that sits with us.  We cry out for something better and redemption and don’t wish it a way because it might be hard.
* To not be conformed to this world but be renewed might mean it hurts.  But the promise might make it worth it all.
