# 2/23 - Transfiguration Sunday (The Driveway)

**Gathering**

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Introit: Jesus, Joy of the Highest Heaven

\*Call to Worship:  
We go with you, O God, to new places.
**Lead us, O God, to where you call us!**
We go with you, O God, knowing the destination, but not the route.
**Lead us, O God, to where you call us!**
We go with you, O God.  
**Lead us, O Creator of all!**

Commentary: Today we’re situated in the driveway.  We’re on our way out from home.  God will lead, but we must be willing to go.

\*Opening Hymn: I Heard The Voice of Jesus Say

\*Prayer of Confession 
**God of the journey,**
**You have led many through the wilderness,**
**And they have found safe harbor.**
**You have led many out of safe harbor,**
**And they have brought forth the Kingdom of God.**

**Gracious God,**
**In the safety of our own harbor,**
**Help us to know when it is time to go.**
**Ease our fears,**
**And help us fight the urge to wall ourselves off**
**Such that there is no way to move.**

**Forgive us when we ignore your call to move.**

Commentary:  Sometimes, our desire for inertia keeps us from going where God calls us.  It may be fear, it may be comfort, but regardless, the consequence can be not seeing the Kingdom here on earth.  How do we overcome this fear?

\* Assurance of Pardon

_Adam pours the water here._
Hear the good news!
Hope does not disappoint us,
for God’s love has been poured into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit given to us in Baptism.

Believe this good news and give thanks:
**We are called,**
**We are beloved,**
**We are forgiven.  Amen.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign with one another.

**Word**
Prayer for Illumination

Scripture I:  2 Peter 1:16–21 (NRSV)
16For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.
17For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”
18We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.
19So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
20First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation,
21because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

Scripture II:  Matthew 17:1–9 (NRSV)
1Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves.
2And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.
3Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.
4Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
5While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!”
6When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear.
7But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.”
8And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.
9As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”

Message: Our Holy Home: The Driveway

* Eventually, we all have to leave home.  
	* Get togethers cease, coats are put back on, we say good night and goodbye.  
	* We have to get groceries, supplies.
	* And, for most of us, we’ll need to get in our vehicles, and head away.  Lots of times, the last piece of our home we’ll touch before we depart is the driveway.
* The Driveway is a threshold.
	* It’s often our last place to double check what we should bring with us and what we should leave behind.
	* But, obviously, we can’t carry everything.  We try to carry the provisons for the journey we know is coming up.
	* What do we carry from our Holy Home as we head through Lent?
* Carrying transfiguration
	* The transfiguration text gives us a good chance to think about what God invites us to carry.
	* The disciples are overcome by what they see - and wouldn’t we all be?  To see Jesus shining like the sun, Moses and Elijah there too.
	* There’s a temptation to want to bound everything up - make shrines for what’s in front of us.  
	* But Jesus had another task in mind - he knew where he was headed. And so, no tents are made.  It’s time to head back down the mountain.
	* What we’re left with his God’s voice: “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I’m well pleased.”
	* Transfiguration, then, isn’t carried through the physical manifest, but through the story.
* No more 3x5s
	* One of my favorite songs is John Mayer’s “3x5"
	_Today I finally overcame_
	_Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame_
	_Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to_
	_Lose my way but let me say_
	
	_You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes_
	_It brought me back to life_
	_You'll be with me next time I go outside_
	_No more 3x5's_
	_Just no more 3x5__’s_
	* We can’t carry everything, nor can we block out our faith into a simple picture frame.  
	* Instead, it may be our ability to carry with us the way what we experience is life altering, and invite others on the journey with us.  To tell of beautiful sunrises, lives changed, faces illumined by God-light.
	* As we leave our Holy Home, what is is like to carry those stories through Lent?  To share them?  To experience them?

Hymn: Christ of the Upward Way

Children’s Time

Commentary: On Communion Sunday, we invite the children to help carry the elements down to the table. In the PCUSA, we invite all who have been baptized to come to the table, regardless of their age. Our Book of Order invites parents to make a decision as to their desire for their children to partake in communion.

Commentary
As we leave this series and move into Lent, the question might still be “so what?”  How do we live with the ideas of Our Holy Home in mind?  It’s helpful to go back through the series first: 

1. The Yard was a reminder that those outside might not see the same thing we see on the inside - how do we help people see who we really are?
2. The Coat Room was the space that reminded us that vulnerability takes different shapes, especially as folks may have had to wear their coats a long time.
3. The Living Room was the space where we get to know people in different ways - deep knowing and surface knowing.
4. The Kitchen was a reminder that many different ingredients (even the less glamorous ones) are what sustain us.
5. The Bathroom is a space to remember that while we are in need of some cleaning, we’re not completely a mess, either.
6. The Bedroom was a place to think about how rest is not just an end unto itself, but has purpose and direction.

Perhaps you want to remind yourself about these ideas in your own home.  Writing a note somewhere in each room can help.  Or, as we’ve discussed today, what’s most important is finding the ideas most important for you to carry and to hold on to those.  However, what is most important is how Our Holy Home here - Old Stone - is a place where people on their journey can find rest.  There may be no more important purpose of the church heading into the middle of the 21st Century than to be refuge who want to know God’s love, yet cannot find a space where they can witness radical love and hospitality.  Our story as a congregation tells stories of that radical love and hospitality to us, our present reflects it, and our future demands it.  There may be no better time than now, as we continue to transition and move to where God is calling to recommit to Our Holy Home.
