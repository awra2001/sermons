# 3/8 - Lent 2

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

Call to Worship: 
We lift our eyes to the hills—
from where does our help come?
**Our help comes from the Lord,**
**who made heaven and earth.**
The Lord is our keeper;
God protects us, heart and soul.
**Whether coming or going,**
**we are safe in God’s keeping.**
Our journeys have brought us here
to lift our voices in praise.
**We will worship our Creator all the days**
**of our lives.**

Commentary:  Our journey continues.  This week, we move into reflection on penitence and self-examination.  This work can be some of the most challenging.  It’s easy to become anxious as we have to explore our brokenness and that of the world.  However, God has not changed - God still guides and gives us grace.

\* Opening Hymn:  God of Grace and God of Glory
Commentary: This hymn is a prayer, in which we ask for God's wisdom and courage to face the problems of our day. We beg for God's power, confess our fear and pride, and affirm a desire to seek social justice.

\* Prayer of Confession
_Friends__, in our journey, God is with us, and always willing to hear us when we cry for grace.  Let us then_ _approach_ _God with our corporate confessions, saying:_

**Gracious God,**
**Forgive us for the things we’ve done,**
**And the things we’ve left undone:**
**The way we have treated others and ourselves,**
**Preferring to loft rocks of judgement**
**than draw lines of grace.**

**Create in us clean, open, responsive hearts, O God,**
**full of grace and hope:**
**and renew a right spirit of self-reflection in each of us.**

Commentary:  For Lent, we will hear the beginning of a familiar confession - asking for forgiveness for both the sins of commission (what we’ve done), and omission (what’s left undone).  In the gospel, we’ll consider the woman caught in adultery and Christ’s call against violent justice.  This hurling of stones is not just to others, but also something we do to ourselves: we can be on both sides of the line.  What does it mean to receive Christ’s call - that we are not the ones who judge?

\* Assurance of Pardon
_Hear the waters of baptism, the sounds of our forgiveness._
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Special Music: Let This Mind Be in You (Shandi Anthony, flute) 

Commentary: On our Lenten journey, we are reminded that the way of Jesus is a path we can follow.

Children’s Time 

Chorus: God Welcomes All

Prayer for Illumination: 
Gracious God, 
give us humble, teachable, and obedient hearts, 
that we may receive what you have revealed, 
and do what you have commanded. **Amen.**

Reading:  John 7:45–8:18 (NRSV)
45Then the temple police went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why did you not arrest him?”
46The police answered, “Never has anyone spoken like this!”
47Then the Pharisees replied, “Surely you have not been deceived too, have you?
48Has any one of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?
49But this crowd, which does not know the law—they are accursed.”
50Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, asked,
51“Our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing, does it?”
52They replied, “Surely you are not also from Galilee, are you? Search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from Galilee.”
53Then each of them went home,
1while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
2Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them.
3The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them,
4they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.
5Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”
6They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.
7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”
8And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.
9When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.
10Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
11She said, “No one, sir.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.”
12Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”
13Then the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.”
14Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
15You judge by human standards; I judge no one.
16Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.
17In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.
18I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.”

Message: Journeying Through Lent with Examination

	The things I’m the worst at in daily life are often the things that I’m least happy to hear about.  Maybe it’s the same with you.
		Do you have a friend who lives by the code “being early is on time, being on time is late, and being late is unacceptable?"
			This can be a dividing concept for many people.
				We can tease and goad in front of and behind people - “oh, they’re always late"
				
			But, you know, it tends not to mean that person gets to where they need to go any earlier.  
			
		I recognize the times I need to practice some better ways of doing things, but in the midst of the lectures or the judgement, it’s much harder for me to process that.
		
	Sometimes it can be cultural (like the homelessness issue).  Things related to our concept of “stigma” can often have the same effect on people.
	
	There’s a point when our concepts of what is wrong and who is wrong become toxic.  
		Ronald Potter-Efron:
			Guilt - “Lets us know we’ve done something wrong… a transgression, a reaction to what is deemed an inappropriate action.” vs.
			
			Shame “one’s shortcomings as a total being"
			
			Toxic shame tells us "we're going to fail to reach our goals in life". It begets more shame, causing "paralysis, faltering energy, escapism, withdrawal, including people-pleasing and hiding behind a mask, perfectionism, criticism, and rage.” This is why our cultural implications about the homeless can be so dangerous - we create a shame cycle the more we equate circumstance with identity. 
			
		Guilty about being late vs. shame about being late.
		
		Our ability to journey through lent with the companion of self-examination (and penitent self-examination in particular) means we have to consider what it means have good awareness of the countours of guilt and shame.
		
	The Gospel text
		There’s so much to unpack about judgement - which is an outward examination.  We can take some of it for both how we judge others, and perhaps how we judge ourselves as well.
		
		Nicodemus
			We hear the strands of judgment - well, you’ve been deceived!  Well, there’s no such thing as a prophet out of Galilee! And it’s untrue for multiple reasons - Jonah was a prophet from Galilee - but the judgement is cast.
			
			The guards are dismissed simply because they’re different.  They see things differently than the Pharisees.
			
		The woman
			The law here was to prescribe stoning only if she was a betrothed virgin, and the man should be stoned as well.  
			
			And this would have been a trap for Jesus.  But, Jesus does what’s most important - he seeks the heart of the woman.
			
			Jesus neither casts judgement nor completely absolves.  There is guilt, but not shame.  “Condemn” here in the greek is a punitive sentence.  She is free to move forward.
			
		The Pharisees
		
		

\* Hymn: Grace Greater Than All Our Sin

Commentary: Joining with the sermon, we sing the same truth: God’s grace is always greater than anything we could ever do.

\* Affirmation of Faith:
**We believe in God, Creator and Creating;**
**who gives us steadfast love, and shares with us our joy,**
**and sustains us in our suffering.**
**We trust in God’s power in the world.**

**We follow Jesus Christ, fully God, fully human.**
**In death was victory, in resurrection was hope;**
**in him the Word became flesh; in him we are offered**
**forgiveness from sin, renewal from failure, reconciliation**
**from brokenness, release from despair.**

**We are guided by the Holy Spirit, God’s presence in the world.**

**By the Spirit we are called into the Church,**
**to celebrate love, seek justice and resist evil,**
**to proclaim Jesus, crucified and risen,**
**to share with Christ’s Baptism and to eat at Christ’s Table.**

**Because we are God’s disciples, a pilgrim people,**
**we joyfully covenant with each other to walk together in love,**
**pray for one another, care for one another,**
**And live in holy community, in life, in death, in life beyond death.**

**God is with us. We are not alone. Thanks be to God.**

Prayers of the People

The Lord’s Prayer

Offering

Doxology

\* Hymn - Lonesome Valley

Commentary: While we walk together, the one who leads us must travel alone.  Some of these verses are adapted and/or original, by Greg Menssen and Jim Fischer.

\* Charge and Benediction 

\* Postlude

Closing Commentary:  On Ash Wednesday, these words were spoken:

I invite you, therefore, in the name of Christ,
to observe a holy Lent
by self-examination and penitence,
by prayer and fasting,
by works of love,
and by meditating on God’s word.

Self-examination and penitence are the hardest parts of Lent - no other time are we more focused on the more uncomfortable sides of who we are.  This time is not meant for complete avoidance of our brokenness, but neither is it a time for a constant self-flagellation of ourselves or others.  Instead, what Christ offers us (and what Lent invites us to take up) is space for honest reflection, and the grace to not be mired in what we discover, but instead to continue moving with Christ towards Easter.

Resurrection exists.  Life after death is real.  All the many ways we lose our lives in our sin can lead to new life in grace.  It’s in the interim time, between the line in the sand and the open tomb that we can explore exactly what that may mean for each of us.  But it means to have an unflinchingly eye to ourselves and our world, its sin and brokenness, and a resolve to have faith in a grace that restores.
