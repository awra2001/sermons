# 2/9 - Epiphany 5 (The Bathroom)

Welcome, Announcements, Prayer

Prelude

\*Call to Worship:
Gracious God, we come home:
**Hopeful for rest, renewal, and connection.**
Gracious God, we come home:
**Needing washed, healed, and restored.**
Gracious God, we come home:
**Let us worship the One who is our home.**

Commentary: We shift in our last couple weeks in our Holy Home to focus on more intimate spaces of renewal.  What is it like for us, in the midst of business and connection, to find renewal?

\* Opening Hymn: There Is A Fountain

\* Prayer of Confession
O God, some of us are discouraged
and long for your embrace.
**Wash us with your love.**
Some of us are weary,
weighed down by the desperation of this world.
**Wash us with your hope.**
Some of us are anxious
and seek refuge from chaotic lives.
**Wash us with your peace.**
Some of us are restless,
yearning for renewal or transformation.
**Wash us with your grace.**
However we come into your presence,
pour out your Spirit upon us.
**Forgive us our fears,**
**And lead us to You.**

Commentary: If this confession seems familiar, it is - it was the Call To Worship in our first week of our series.  Perhaps we still carry the weight of a broken world - our own brokenness as well.  What is it like to revisit our initial call, and truly lay our fear, our desperations, and our anxieties with our Savior, and accept a cleansing touch of low, hope, peace, and grace?

\* Assurance of Pardon
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.    

Children’s Time 

Chorus: God Welcomes All

Prayer for Illumination: 
God,
Give us quiet minds, open hearts, piqued ears.
Help us be near you.  Amen.

First Reading:  Psalm 121:1–8 (NRSV)
1I lift up my eyes to the hills— from where will my help come?
2My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
3He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber.
4He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
5The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade at your right hand.
6The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
7The Lord will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life.
8The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time on and forevermore.

Second Reading:  John 13:6–14 (NRSV)
6He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
7Jesus answered, “You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”
8Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.”
9Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”
10Jesus said to him, “One who has bathed does not need to wash, except for the feet, but is entirely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”
11For he knew who was to betray him; for this reason he said, “Not all of you are clean.”
12After he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you?
13You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am.
14So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.

Message: Our Holy Home: The Bathroom
**THE POINT:** There’s a balance in brokenness and grace, explored in vulnerability with God and community.

	When people heard we’d do a Sunday on the bathroom, quite a few did a “really?” look.  And we joked about what we should put up here.
	
	It’s funny how even as adults, we can feel uncomfortable around conversations about the bathroom.  Why is that?
		In our daily lives, it might be the place we’re most exposed.  We can’t hide there, and truly, our humanity is exposed.  
		
		It’s a completely unfiltered moment in our days.  And, I don’t think we often like to be exposed in that way.  
		
		It’s another moment where we are vulnerable.  We talked about this at the beginning in the coat room.  If it’s the place where our guests become more vulnerable, the bathroom is where we become vulnerable.
		
	Let’s even take the act of washing or bathing.
		When we’re young, we are washed by our parents.  And there’s a particular rite of passage that every parent must have a photo somewhere of washing their child.  That vulnerability and imperfection is expected of one so young.
		
		As we age though, we may need that same help from our children.  And it’s not the same right of passage.  That vulnerability and imperfection aren’t expected in the same way.
		
		And it can causes us to wait too long for help at times.  To be upset about it, to see it and ourselves as some sort of failure.  
		
	This seems to be the same thing Peter’s going through.
		Jesus is making it very clear as one of his final acts here in the world that he’s going to take on a task that is vulnerable for both him and the disciples.  This is not perceived as the thing someone in his position should do, and moreover, not the thing that should be done to one of the disciples.
		
		And so Peter gives us two extremes:
			The first instinct is not at all.  I won’t be this kind of vulnerable with you, Jesus.  This work is meant for someone else, Jesus.  You’re asking to be in a place that I’m not interested in being vulnerable.  You’ll see my imperfect feet, what I see as gross and untouchable.  Jesus’s response is that unless you let me do this, then you’re not a part of who I am - better translation “You are not sharing in my company".
			
			Okay, Peter says, why not go for the home run, and says “okay, wash all of me!  Let’s go for broke!”
				Jesus gives us an interesting play on words then: καθαρός can have two meanings in the text: a literal cleaning, or a ritual one.  
				
				Think about catharsis, which at times can feel like an emotional bath.
				
	Jesus puts us into an interesting position then, but it’s a key to our own lives and how we can navigate our lives of vulnerable imperfection.
		The story of being called “dumb dust” - and if you think all you are is dumb dust, you might question why you shouldn’t just be scrubbed off all together.  That what happens if we put ourselves in such a condition about sin that we think that we’re barely lucky to be redeemed.
		
		We can also at times bury our imperfection and brokenness so deep that we might forget it even exists, and so in the naked moments we’re unable to process as we as we could. We might think we need to bury ourselves in all variety of fixes - to be washed over and over everywhere.
		
		Instead, Jesus calls us to a middle ground.  Yes, we are broken, imperfect.  We need cleaning, and the one who we presume has to reason to do the work will.  But we also aren’t so lost that we need some intervention to be welcome into God’s commonwealth.
		
		It’s why we have our confession and pardon, and we pour water.  It’s not that we’re so lost, but we’re not so perfected either.  
		
		But it’s that vulnerability on both sides - that we are broken, but we aren’t irredeemable - that Jesus wants to heal us.
		
	“Go and do"
		This is our call as well.  It means at one side being a people and a place that can invite vulnerability to acknowledge they need cleaned.
		
		But, on the other side, it means being a people that feel no need to denigrate others so as to force them into believing they need a bath every time they walk into the bathroom.
		
		Most importantly, however, it means that we need to be willing to place ourselves in the dirt, grime, grit, and imperfection of each other, and seek to clean it.
		
		It means hard conversations and soft hugs.  Seeing brokenness and belovedness in the same person at the same time always.  It means holding a space in the tension of the world that is inconvenient but so needed.

Closing Commentary:  It’s strange to think of the bathroom as a place of theological significance, but it truly is one of the places where we are our most unvarnished and most human.  Perhaps no where else are we more determined to overcome the ways we naturally smell, look, feel, taste, and function than in the bathroom.  As such, we often will share that space with only the most intimate of our community - and even then that might not always be the case.  Yet, it may be precisely in the bathroom, and all of the ways that we care for ourselves there that Jesus might be invited.  A Savior that was willing to wash feet, but also would accept the disciples as they were, seeing them clean.  What is it like to share that delicate intimacy with others?  An intimacy that invites a cleansing touch without shame?
