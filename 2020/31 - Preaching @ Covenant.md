# 3/1 - Preaching @ Covenant

Psalm 32:1–11 (NRSV)
1Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
2Happy are those to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
3While I kept silence, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long.
4For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
5Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not hide my iniquity; I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,” and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
6Therefore let all who are faithful offer prayer to you; at a time of distress, the rush of mighty waters shall not reach them.
7You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with glad cries of deliverance. Selah
8I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
9Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding, whose temper must be curbed with bit and bridle, else it will not stay near you.
10Many are the torments of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds those who trust in the Lord.
11Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart.

Matthew 4:1–11 (NRSV)
1Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
2He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished.
3The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
4But he answered, “It is written, ‘One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”
5Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,
6saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’ ”
7Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”
8Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor;
9and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”
10Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! for it is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’ ”
11Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels came and waited on him.

* Hangry is a word that has over the last few years seeped its way back into the American lexicon.
	* Apparently the word first came into the being in the 1950s, but now it’s come back.
	* It’s a type of specific hunger that leads to ill-tempered behavior.  
	* We might feel so hungry that we are capable of overreacting to small things that otherwise we’d let slide in a more sated state.
	* It’s a real thing, too: as our blood glucose decreases, it triggers cortisol (stress hormone) and adrenaline.  Moreover, lower blood glucose leaves us more prone to be controlled by more primitive drives and behaviors. 
* That might be a way to describe a church going through transition: hangry.
	* All of the churches I’ve attended since I became presbyterian have been in transition.  I am now the longest installed pastor I’ve had experience with.
	* When our called pastor leaves, it’s all too easy to start to think that our regular food is going away.
	* After awhile, we start getting hunger pains.  And, maybe at first, we’re okay because we felt full before
	* But, given enough time, we can start to get hangry.
	* Our more primal instincts take over - fight-or-flight.  Fight about everything, or fly off to a new congregation.  
* I wonder if Jesus was hangry, too.
	* The word here translated as “famished,” is ἐπείνασεν.  A word that means “to be or become in need or want to food; especially when one experiences hunger pangs…” super nice way of saying hangry.
	* And then, at the end of his wilderness journey, he has this interesting dialogue with the devil.  
	* But note the beginning: tempter.  πειράζων.  More directly translated it is “the one testing.”  This is a final exam on the wilderness, and the devil is proctor.
	* The exam is over a few topics: taking care of present pain, self-destruction, and power.  
	* But, Jesus responds to each.  It seems like the time in the wilderness has served him well.  There was something to gain on the journey.  He is swift in response, and the response comes from a relationship with God.  This isn’t just prooftexting, but connecting the text to something about being.
	* He passes.  And the angels aren’t just feeding him - they’re ministering to him - the word here is the same root where we get deacons.  This is a group of the best deacons coming to care for Jesus.  If Jesus was hangry, he isn’t any longer.
* The test of the wilderness.
	* The hanger a congregation in transition feels is an indication of the wilderness journey it must attend.  And while it doesn’t quite seem fair, there will be little devils proctoring along the way.  
	* However, like Jesus, it seems as though the wilderness has something to offer us in growing and preparing.  If we don’t use the wilderness well, we might be less prepared for when the final examination comes.  We might be apt to choose the immediate relief from hunger, we may want to throw ourselves off the cliff, or delude ourselves with false senses of power, and perhaps miss out on the true ministry at the end.
	* So perhaps, it the midst of Lent in the midst of transition, you might want to recommit yourself to this wilderness.  The mission study committee is doing its job.  A MIF will be completed soon enough.  What do you do with now?  How do you look through your hanger to the blessings of the wilderness?  How are you stronger and more equipped because of this time?  If you’re stronger now, you’ll be even more equipped.
