Prelude

Welcome, Announcements

Call to Worship: 
**God of triumph:**
**We celebrate!**
**With palms held high**
**We celebrate!**
**Though the pain of the cross is near**
**We celebrate!**
**God of triumph, help us to worship and celebrate the King who has come to save!**

\* Opening Hymn:

\* Prayer of Confession
**Gracious God,**
**Forgive us for the things we’ve done,**
**And the things we’ve left undone:**

**That we hoard precious hope and grace,**
**Unwilling to pour out the sweet and pleasant fragrance of a healing word or restoring act.**

**Help us, O God, remember what we truly need, and to give freely**
**To help other receive what they need.**

\* Assurance of Pardon
_Hear the waters of baptism, the sounds of our forgiveness._
Friends and family, let us remember.
**We are called.**
**We are beloved.**
**We are forgiven.**

\* Passing of the Peace
The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
**And also with you.**
Let us share a sign of that peace to one another.

\* Affirmation of Faith:
**We believe in God, Creator and Creating;**
**who gives us steadfast love, and shares with us our joy,**
**and sustains us in our suffering.**
**We trust in God’s power in the world.**

**We follow Jesus Christ, fully God, fully human.**
**In death was victory, in resurrection was hope;**
**in him the Word became flesh; in him we are offered**
**forgiveness from sin, renewal from failure, reconciliation**
**from brokenness, release from despair.**

**We are guided by the Holy Spirit, God’s presence in the world.**

**By the Spirit we are called into the Church,**
**to celebrate love, seek justice and resist evil,**
**to proclaim Jesus, crucified and risen,**
**to share with Christ’s Baptism and to eat at Christ’s Table.**

**Because we are God’s disciples, a pilgrim people,**
**we joyfully covenant with each other to walk together in love,**
**pray for one another, care for one another,**
**And live in holy community, in life, in death, in life beyond death.**

**God is with us. We are not alone. Thanks be to God.**

Closing Commentary:  On Ash Wednesday, these words were spoken:

I invite you, therefore, in the name of Christ,

by prayer and fasting,
by works of love,
and by meditating on God’s word.
