# Christmas 1: 2020

Psalm 148
148:1 Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights!
148:2 Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his host!
148:3 Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars!
148:4 Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens!
148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for he commanded and they were created.
148:6 He established them forever and ever; he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed.
148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, you sea monsters and all deeps,
148:8 fire and hail, snow and frost, stormy wind fulfilling his command!
148:9 Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars!
148:10 Wild animals and all cattle, creeping things and flying birds!
148:11 Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth!
148:12 Young men and women alike, old and young together!
148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his glory is above earth and heaven.
148:14 He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his faithful, for the people of Israel who are close to him. Praise the LORD!

Luke 2:22-40
2:22 When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
2:23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord"),
2:24 and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, "a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."
2:25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.
2:26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
2:27 Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,
2:28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
2:29 "Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word;
2:30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
2:31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
2:32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel."
2:33 And the child's father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.
2:34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, "This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed
2:35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed--and a sword will pierce your own soul too."
2:36 There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
2:37 then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day.
2:38 At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
2:39 When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
2:40 The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.

* What they must've seen.
	* These two, Simeon and Anna, are these lovely, characters that enter our text for a brief but beautiful moment.
	* Both are prophets, and are very old
		* The tradition is that Simeon may be over 200 years old, although that's likely not the case.
		* Because of the ambiguity of the text, we don't know if Anna is 84 years old, or has been without her husband for 84 years, which at the minimum would make her 105.
	* And with that age, and with their positions, they would have witnessed a lot.
		* They would have known the stories of their ancestors - of the prophets throughout the history of Israel and Judah.
		* They would have known the exile.  Anna, as an Asherite, would have been one of the "ten lost tribes" of Israel. Her story is one of being conquered.
		* The fifty years leading up to the birth of Jesus saw a massive increase in the power of Rome, and Ceasar Augustus
			* Kurt Willems: During the first century, Rome had dominion over Israel.  In 63 BCE, after much turmoil and civil war within Israel, the Romans invaded and conquered Jerusalem.  In order to keep control over the Galilean and Judean peoples, Julius Caesar and the Senate installed Herod as king.  It would take Herod three years to finally gain all control over the still hostile Jews, but he would in due course keep a firm rule over the whole region.  He eventually became one of Augustus’ favorite military leaders, and was admired by the new emperor because of his immense development program.  Not only did Herod expand the Temple in Jerusalem to be more grandiose and Hellenistic-Roman in style, but he also imposed a sacrifice that the priests would give on behalf of Rome and the emperor.  Additionally, Herod had whole cities named to give reverence to Caesar as well as imperial temples and fortresses to reinforce Roman control.  The great building campaigns were not possible without taxing the peoples of Galilee, Samaria, and Judea greatly; leaving the majority in poverty.  Not only were they required to pay taxes to the Empire, but they continued to function as a “temple-state” and were also required to pay the tithes and sacrifices of the Jewish religion.  The offensiveness of being forced into what could be labeled idolatry along as the difficult economic reality must not be understated.  Richard Horsley states:  The demand for tribute to Rome and taxes to Herod in addition to the tithes and offerings to the Temple and priesthood dramatically escalated the economic pressures on peasant producers, whose livelihood was perennially marginal at best.  After decades of multiple demands from multiple layers of rulers many village families fell increasingly into debt and were faced with loss of their family inheritance of land.  The impoverishment of families led to the disintegration of village communities, the fundamental social form of such an agrarian society.  These are precisely the deteriorating conditions that Jesus addresses in the Gospels: impoverishment, hunger, and debt.
			* The consequences, too, were visible - it's not as though crucifixion was a new thing invented for Jesus.
			* Anna, of course, not only had witnessed what Simeon had, but also had the decades of living as a widow in a world that granted its power to men.
* We, too, have witnessed much in the last year.
	* My heart is heavy with the story of Andre Hill.
		* He a black man was killed in his garage, by two officers responding to a non-emergency noise complaint. 
		* We add this to a long, long list of good people killed this year for seemingly no other reason than their skin color.
	* My heart is heavy with the continued toll of a virus still raging
		* The toll is now 1:1000 people we've lost
		* And there's light at the end, but it still feels a little more distant.
	* My heart is heavy with the loss of support because of political strife.
		* People are losing their benefits at a critical time.
		* And at best, if something happens today and tomorrow, people will lose lifelines that kept them afloat.
	* Impoverishment, hunger, debt, marginalization, xenophobia (remember - the Jewish people abhored the Samaritans) - it's what Jesus addresses.
* The Christmas hope
	* All of this that they've witnessed, comes to this moment.  In temple.
	* Simeon takes the infant in his arms.  He looks at the child and sees his promises revealed. 
	* Anna comes, too, and all that she's prayed and fasted for is revealed.  There is redemption to come.
	* This isn't a long moment - in both of their lives, it's fleeting.  But all their history is changed. 
	* What is it like to hold the hope of decades as new born in our arms?  All of the hope and joy?
	* It's delicate, fragile, unable to speak on its own. 
	* It doesn't change what we've seen, but it might supply us with a new way of considering it - that none of these moments get the final say.
