# Richer Meals

**Psalm 133**
133:1 How very good and pleasant it is when kindred live together in unity!
133:2 It is like the precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down over the collar of his robes.
133:3 It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD ordained his blessing, life forevermore.

**Genesis 45:1-15**
45:1 Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, "Send everyone away from me." So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
45:2 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at his presence.
45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come closer to me." And they came closer. He said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.
45:5 And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
45:6 For the famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
45:7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
45:8 So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
45:9 Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
45:10 You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, as well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
45:11 I will provide for you there--since there are five more years of famine to come--so that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to poverty.
45:12 And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my own mouth that speaks to you.
45:13 You must tell my father how greatly I am honored in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here."
45:14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck.
45:15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with him.

**Matthew 15: (10-20), 21-28**
15:10 Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, "Listen and understand:
15:11 it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles."
15:12 Then the disciples approached and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?"
15:13 He answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
15:14 Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit."
15:15 But Peter said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
15:16 Then he said, "Are you also still without understanding?
15:17 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?
15:18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles.
15:19 For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.
15:20 These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile."
15:21 Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
15:22 Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon."
15:23 But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, "Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us."
15:24 He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
15:25 But she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me."
15:26 He answered, "It is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
15:27 She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
15:28 Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed instantly.

* We seek church in part because it’s a comfort to us.
* We want it to be a place just like we think about in Ps 133
	* Oil on Aaron’s beard - it’s an image that reminds us of the connections of feasting and worship.
* But, that comfort requires us to draw from some place.  It doesn’t just come out of nowhere.  So what do we do when we hunger for something we can’t immediately get?
	* We can have sweets, or fast food - but it hurts our systems
	* Or, we can get true well made meals, but it means we may have to work hard to make it.
* Jospeh
	* The convenient option would have been vengeance.  He had power, he had authority, he could have booted his family out.
	* Instead, though, he prepares something greater - he cares for his family.  He ensures that they will be safe, well fed, and flourish.
	* He didn’t need to, but the fast food option would have hurt him more than what satisfies everyone.
* The Canaanite Woman and Jesus
	* The easy option here Jesus would have been to ignore the woman.  
	* Or, even easier, to just play along with the disciples, who are actively bullying the woman.  
	* But instead, he listens.  He begins to reveal an entire shift of his ministry, which is important in Matthew.  This isn’t just for the chosen people, but Jesus will be for all.
	* Jesus focuses on the faithfulness of the woman - her heart - and that sets about healing.
* There will always be an urge to seek the thing that will feed us quickly, but especially now, that’s hard.
	* We are hungry.  No doubt.  We dream of feasting again.
	* But the cheapest option will only satisfy us for so long.
		* The urge to be upset and annoyed at decisions that are prayerfully being considered.  To want to seek our own vengance on what’s happening all around us.
		* The urge to ignore the calls of those on the outside of what we think is right or outside our ministry because they don’t fit the mold of what we think is the right thing.
	* Instead, what’s it like for us to make richer meals?  Something more long lasting?  A feast that is equal banquet and anointing?
	* Even for us in a time that feels so removed, we can make deeper meals.  We can seek each other, find each other, provide flourishing for one another in the midst of being able to push people away, and to give more than the crumbs to someone else.  That’s a banquet for us and the other.
