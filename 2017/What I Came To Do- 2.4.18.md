What I Came To Do: 2.4.18
I Cor 9:16-23; Mark 1:29-39 

**1 Corinthians 9:16-23**
9:16 If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the gospel! 
9:17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. 
9:18 What then is my reward? Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.
9:19 For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I might win more of them. 
9:20 To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law. 
9:21 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law) so that I might win those outside the law. 
9:22 To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some. 
9:23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.

**Mark 1:29-39**
1:29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
1:30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. 
1:31 He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. Then the fever left her, and she began to serve them. 
1:32 That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons. 
1:33 And the whole city was gathered around the door. 
1:34 And he cured many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. 
1:35 In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed. 
1:36 And Simon and his companions hunted for him. 
1:37 When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is searching for you."
1:38 He answered, "Let us go on to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do." 
1:39 And he went throughout Galilee, proclaiming the message in their synagogues and casting out demons.

When I was growing up, I remember hearing the commercial from Gatorade that  said “I want to be like Mike.”  Referring to Michael Jordan, the commercial takes shows some of Jordan’s most iconic moments (including when he shot the buzzer beater that ruined the Cleveland Cavaliers chances at the playoffs) interspersed with all sorts of other people playing basketball, not doing so well, but all smiling because, as the commercial says, they might for even a moment be like Mike, even if perhaps it’s only to swig some Gatorade out of the then-glass bottles.

There’s a reason why commercials like that have an attraction to us - the idea of a role model, someone to ascribe too, is part of how we understand ourselves.  From the first moment we put on our dad’s hat or mom’s shoes, the first time that we try on one of their mannerisms or speak, we look to someone trusted and with more experience to help appreciate how we are to live in the world.  If I want to become a better basketball player, Michael Jordan isn’t too bad of a role model.  My dad was a role model because he showed how to care for a family each and every day.  My grandfather was my first role model in ministry.  And research has shown that under the right circumstances, role models can have significant effect on changing the goals, mood, opinions, and values of people who aspire to be like them.  

I’m certain that this is part of why so often Jesus becomes a role model for us.  #role-model #discipleship 
- Fed the hungry
- Went around the countryside telling people about good news
- Even the stories where he was crabby seem to have meaning to them
- Was selfless, even to the point of death for people who did not even exist yet

But, I find myself, and I’m sure you might too, saying in moments that it is really, really hard to be like Jesus.
- Do I need to feed THAT hungry person?
- What good news is there right now?
- I need to watch the Super Bowl tonight even though I don’t know who’s playing!
- I might argue I’d have an easier time being Michael Jordan than Jesus of Nazareth. It might have something to do with the whole not being fully good and just fully human, which, as far as I know, is something MJ and I share.

And so, it’s easy to say that while it’d be nice to be like Jesus, we’re not really going to get there, so why even try?  
- I can’t heal the way Jesus did to Simon’s mother-in-law!
- What have we to gain in the failure?
- Maybe more damaging is that we abandon it altogether, knowing that it is too hard.

I wonder if Paul is a more helpful role model
- He was certainly human, and certainly acted it from time to time
- And moreover, he too was responding to Jesus and is a helpful interpreter of what to do when you’re fully human

I Cor Passage
- Context: the consumption of idol food.  Believers in Christ felt it was okay to take some of the food, while others felt that it was also part of participating in some kind of ritual.  
- Carla Works: “To relate this dilemma to a context that we can understand, many of us pray before a meal. To some, that prayer may seem perfunctory, a mere ritual. To others at the same meal, that prayer may be deeply meaningful. Nonetheless, the words of the prayer give thanks to God. Does participation in the prayer necessarily mean that one is acknowledging that there is a god who is worthy of thanksgiving? Can one participate in religious rites out of respect without believing the words that are being spoken?” (the Bible that sits on the desk)
- Paul’s response?  That even though there is a privilege to be had, we must be willing to forego it for the benefit of others.
- Though I am free, I’ve become a slave: though I have been liberated by the gospel message, I’m willing to follow by a set of rules in order to love those around me.  This is not some kind of sycophantic attempt at inconsistency in order to appease someone.  It’s the opposite - a firm hold into the gospel message that exhorts us to be with others, no matter how inconvenient.
- This doesn’t seem to be a comfortable realization either - not something to be cocky about.  Paul calls the gospel an obligation.  
	- Of course it is!  I’d rather have my benefits whenever they’re available to me.
	- Televangelist scandals and their implications - yes, it’s wrong because there is a moral implication, but how much more damaging is it to others who are looking at the church?
	- Our largest sins are not of moral degradation as we often point to, but our arrogance to assume that we have no reason to become bound to the service of others.
- It requires us somehow to be the lowly.  To surrender much of our privileges in order to seek the lost.  To go places amongst the “weak.”  

Perhaps, then, our desire to be like Jesus Christ is to be able to have the privilege of liberation without the realization that we must loose the chains from others.  That the healing of this world, over and over and over again was what Jesus was called out to do.  I give up on being Jesus Christ because I want to be me.

So, maybe this doesn’t make this any better.  But buried within the gospel passage, sadly often overlooked, we can come back to Simons’ mother-in-law.
- She was sick
- She was held
- She was healed
- She served
- Simon’s unnamed mother-in-law becomes the best role model we have.  There is no question, there is no second guess - in Mark’s always-on-the-move gospel language, we move towards action.
- The greatest role models are the ones who do the the work they have been set out to do.  Not hang back amongst the feasts and live within the privilege of faith (or any other for that matter) but to be held, healed, and serve.  
- It may be when we are most like Simon’s mother-in-law that we meet Jesus, and look even for just a moment like him.
